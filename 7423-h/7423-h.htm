CHAPTER I<br><br>
MIKE</a></h3>

<p>It was a morning in the middle of
April, and the Jackson family were consequently breakfasting
in comparative silence.&#160; The cricket season had
not begun, and except during the cricket season they
were in the habit of devoting their powerful minds
at breakfast almost exclusively to the task of victualling
against the labours of the day.&#160; In May, June,
July, and August the silence was broken.&#160; The three
grown-up Jacksons played regularly in first-class
cricket, and there was always keen competition among
their brothers and sisters for the copy of the <i>Sportsman</i>
which was to be found on the hall table with the letters.&#160;
Whoever got it usually gloated over it in silence till
urged wrathfully by the multitude to let them know
what had happened; when it would appear that Joe had
notched his seventh century, or that Reggie had been
run out when he was just getting set, or, as sometimes
occurred, that that ass Frank had dropped Fry or Hayward
in the slips before he had scored, with the result
that the spared expert had made a couple of hundred
and was still going strong.</p>

<p>In such a case the criticisms of the
family circle, particularly of the smaller Jackson
sisters, were so breezy and unrestrained that Mrs.
Jackson generally felt it necessary to apply the closure.&#160;
Indeed, Marjory Jackson, aged fourteen, had on three
several occasions been fined pudding at lunch for
her caustic comments on the batting of her brother
Reggie in important fixtures.&#160; Cricket was a tradition
in the family, and the ladies, unable to their sorrow
to play the game themselves, were resolved that it
should not be their fault if the standard was not
kept up.</p>

<p>On this particular morning silence
reigned.&#160; A deep gasp from some small Jackson,
wrestling with bread-and-milk, and an occasional remark
from Mr. Jackson on the letters he was reading, alone
broke it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mike&#8217;s late again,&#8221;
said Mrs. Jackson plaintively, at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s getting up,&#8221;
said Marjory.&#160; &#8220;I went in to see what he
was doing, and he was asleep.&#160; So,&#8221; she
added with a satanic chuckle, &#8220;I squeezed a
sponge over him.&#160; He swallowed an awful lot, and
then he woke up, and tried to catch me, so he&#8217;s
certain to be down soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marjory!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he was on his back with
his mouth wide open.&#160; I had to.&#160; He was snoring
like anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might have choked him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; said Marjory
with satisfaction.&#160; &#8220;Jam, please, Phyllis,
you pig.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson looked up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mike will have to be more punctual when he
goes to Wrykyn,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, father, is Mike going to Wrykyn?&#8221;
asked Marjory.&#160; &#8220;When?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Next term,&#8221; said Mr.
Jackson.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;ve just heard from Mr.
Wain,&#8221; he added across the table to Mrs. Jackson.&#160;
&#8220;The house is full, but he is turning a small
room into an extra dormitory, so he can take Mike
after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first comment on this momentous
piece of news came from Bob Jackson.&#160; Bob was
eighteen.&#160; The following term would be his last
at Wrykyn, and, having won through so far without
the infliction of a small brother, he disliked the
prospect of not being allowed to finish as he had
begun.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say!&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He ought to have gone before,&#8221;
said Mr. Jackson.&#160; &#8220;He&#8217;s fifteen.&#160;
Much too old for that private school.&#160; He has
had it all his own way there, and it isn&#8217;t good
for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got cheek enough for ten,&#8221;
agreed Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wrykyn will do him a world of good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We aren&#8217;t in the same house.&#160; That&#8217;s
one comfort.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob was in Donaldson&#8217;s.&#160;
It softened the blow to a certain extent that Mike
should be going to Wain&#8217;s.&#160; He had the same
feeling for Mike that most boys of eighteen have for
their fifteen-year-old brothers.&#160; He was fond
of him in the abstract, but preferred him at a distance.</p>

<p>Marjory gave tongue again.&#160; She
had rescued the jam from Phyllis, who had shown signs
of finishing it, and was now at liberty to turn her
mind to less pressing matters.&#160; Mike was her special
ally, and anything that affected his fortunes affected
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hooray!&#160; Mike&#8217;s going
to Wrykyn.&#160; I bet he gets into the first eleven
his first term.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Considering there are eight
old colours left,&#8221; said Bob loftily, &#8220;besides
heaps of last year&#8217;s seconds, it&#8217;s hardly
likely that a kid like Mike&#8217;ll get a look in.&#160;
He might get his third, if he sweats.&#8221;</p>

<p>The aspersion stung Marjory.</p>

<p>&#8220;I bet he gets in before you, anyway,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>Bob disdained to reply.&#160; He was
among those heaps of last year&#8217;s seconds to
whom he had referred.&#160; He was a sound bat, though
lacking the brilliance of his elder brothers, and
he fancied that his cap was a certainty this season.&#160;
Last year he had been tried once or twice.&#160; This
year it should be all right.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jackson intervened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on with your breakfast,
Marjory,&#8221; she said.&#160; &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t
say &#8217;I bet&#8217; so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marjory bit off a section of her slice of bread-and-jam.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow, I bet he does,&#8221; she muttered
truculently through it.</p>

<p>There was a sound of footsteps in
the passage outside.&#160; The door opened, and the
missing member of the family appeared.&#160; Mike Jackson
was tall for his age.&#160; His figure was thin and
wiry.&#160; His arms and legs looked a shade too long
for his body.&#160; He was evidently going to be very
tall some day.&#160; In face, he was curiously like
his brother Joe, whose appearance is familiar to every
one who takes an interest in first-class cricket.&#160;
The resemblance was even more marked on the cricket
field.&#160; Mike had Joe&#8217;s batting style to the
last detail.&#160; He was a pocket edition of his century-making
brother.&#160; &#8220;Hullo,&#8221; he said, &#8220;sorry
I&#8217;m late.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was mere stereo.&#160; He had
made the same remark nearly every morning since the
beginning of the holidays.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Marjory, you little
beast,&#8221; was his reference to the sponge incident.</p>

<p>His third remark was of a practical nature.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, what&#8217;s under that dish?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mike,&#8221; began Mr. Jackson&#8212;&#173;this
again was stereo&#8212;&#173;&#8220;you really must
learn to be more punctual&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a chorus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mike, you&#8217;re going to Wrykyn next term,&#8221;
shouted Marjory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mike, father&#8217;s just had
a letter to say you&#8217;re going to Wrykyn next
term.&#8221;&#160; From Phyllis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mike, you&#8217;re going to Wrykyn.&#8221;&#160;
From Ella.</p>

<p>Gladys Maud Evangeline, aged three,
obliged with a solo of her own composition, in six-eight
time, as follows:&#160; &#8220;Mike Wryky.&#160; Mike
Wryky.&#160; Mike Wryke Wryke Wryke Mike Wryke Wryke
Mike Wryke Mike Wryke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, put a green baize cloth over that kid,
somebody,&#8221; groaned Bob.</p>

<p>Whereat Gladys Maud, having fixed
him with a chilly stare for some seconds, suddenly
drew a long breath, and squealed deafeningly for more
milk.</p>

<p>Mike looked round the table.&#160;
It was a great moment.&#160; He rose to it with the
utmost dignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;I say, what&#8217;s
under that dish?&#8221;</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>After breakfast, Mike and Marjory
went off together to the meadow at the end of the
garden.&#160; Saunders, the professional, assisted by
the gardener&#8217;s boy, was engaged in putting up
the net.&#160; Mr. Jackson believed in private coaching;
and every spring since Joe, the eldest of the family,
had been able to use a bat a man had come down from
the Oval to teach him the best way to do so.&#160;
Each of the boys in turn had passed from spectators
to active participants in the net practice in the
meadow.&#160; For several years now Saunders had been
the chosen man, and his attitude towards the Jacksons
was that of the Faithful Old Retainer in melodrama.&#160;
Mike was his special favourite.&#160; He felt that in
him he had material of the finest order to work upon.&#160;
There was nothing the matter with Bob.&#160; In Bob
he would turn out a good, sound article.&#160; Bob
would be a Blue in his third or fourth year, and probably
a creditable performer among the rank and file of a
county team later on.&#160; But he was not a cricket
genius, like Mike.&#160; Saunders would lie awake at
night sometimes thinking of the possibilities that
were in Mike.&#160; The strength could only come with
years, but the style was there already.&#160; Joe&#8217;s
style, with improvements.</p>

<p>Mike put on his pads; and Marjory
walked with the professional to the bowling crease.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mike&#8217;s going to Wrykyn
next term, Saunders,&#8221; she said.&#160; &#8220;All
the boys were there, you know.&#160; So was father,
ages ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he, miss?&#160; I was thinking he would be
soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think he&#8217;ll get into the school
team?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;School team, miss!&#160; Master
Mike get into a school team!&#160; He&#8217;ll be playing
for England in another eight years.&#160; That&#8217;s
what he&#8217;ll be playing for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but I meant next term.&#160;
It would be a record if he did.&#160; Even Joe only
got in after he&#8217;d been at school two years.&#160;
Don&#8217;t you think he might, Saunders?&#160; He&#8217;s
awfully good, isn&#8217;t he?&#160; He&#8217;s better
than Bob, isn&#8217;t he?&#160; And Bob&#8217;s almost
certain to get in this term.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saunders looked a little doubtful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Next term!&#8221; he said.&#160;
&#8220;Well, you see, miss, it&#8217;s this way.&#160;
It&#8217;s all there, in a manner of speaking, with
Master Mike.&#160; He&#8217;s got as much style as
Mr. Joe&#8217;s got, every bit.&#160; The whole thing
is, you see, miss, you get these young gentlemen of
eighteen, and nineteen perhaps, and it stands to reason
they&#8217;re stronger.&#160; There&#8217;s a young
gentleman, perhaps, doesn&#8217;t know as much about
what I call real playing as Master Mike&#8217;s forgotten;
but then he can hit &#8217;em harder when he does hit
&#8217;em, and that&#8217;s where the runs come in.&#160;
They aren&#8217;t going to play Master Mike because
he&#8217;ll be in the England team when he leaves school.&#160;
They&#8217;ll give the cap to somebody that can make
a few then and there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Mike&#8217;s jolly strong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I&#8217;m not saying it
mightn&#8217;t be, miss.&#160; I was only saying don&#8217;t
count on it, so you won&#8217;t be disappointed if
it doesn&#8217;t happen.&#160; It&#8217;s quite likely
that it will, only all I say is don&#8217;t count on
it.&#160; I only hope that they won&#8217;t knock all
the style out of him before they&#8217;re done with
him.&#160; You know these school professionals, miss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t, Saunders.&#160; What are
they like?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s too much
of the come-right-out-at-everything about &#8217;em
for my taste.&#160; Seem to think playing forward the
alpha and omugger of batting.&#160; They&#8217;ll make
him pat balls back to the bowler which he&#8217;d cut
for twos and threes if he was left to himself.&#160;
Still, we&#8217;ll hope for the best, miss.&#160; Ready,
Master Mike?&#160; Play.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Saunders had said, it was all there.&#160;
Of Mike&#8217;s style there could be no doubt.&#160;
To-day, too, he was playing more strongly than usual.&#160;
Marjory had to run to the end of the meadow to fetch
one straight drive.&#160; &#8220;He hit that hard enough,
didn&#8217;t he, Saunders?&#8221; she asked, as she
returned the ball.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he could keep on doing ones
like that, miss,&#8221; said the professional, &#8220;they&#8217;d
have him in the team before you could say knife.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marjory sat down again beside the
net, and watched more hopefully.</p>

CHAPTER II<br><br>
THE JOURNEY DOWN</a></h3>

<p>The seeing off of Mike on the last
day of the holidays was an imposing spectacle, a sort
of pageant.&#160; Going to a public school, especially
at the beginning of the summer term, is no great hardship,
more particularly when the departing hero has a brother
on the verge of the school eleven and three other
brothers playing for counties; and Mike seemed in
no way disturbed by the prospect.&#160; Mothers, however,
to the end of time will foster a secret fear that
their sons will be bullied at a big school, and Mrs.
Jackson&#8217;s anxious look lent a fine solemnity
to the proceedings.</p>

<p>And as Marjory, Phyllis, and Ella
invariably broke down when the time of separation
arrived, and made no exception to their rule on the
present occasion, a suitable gloom was the keynote
of the gathering.&#160; Mr. Jackson seemed to bear
the parting with fortitude, as did Mike&#8217;s Uncle
John (providentially roped in at the eleventh hour
on his way to Scotland, in time to come down with
a handsome tip).&#160; To their coarse-fibred minds
there was nothing pathetic or tragic about the affair
at all. (At the very moment when the train began to
glide out of the station Uncle John was heard to remark
that, in his opinion, these Bocks weren&#8217;t a
patch on the old shaped Larranaga.) Among others present
might have been noticed Saunders, practising late cuts
rather coyly with a walking-stick in the background;
the village idiot, who had rolled up on the chance
of a dole; Gladys Maud Evangeline&#8217;s nurse, smiling
vaguely; and Gladys Maud Evangeline herself, frankly
bored with the whole business.</p>

<p>The train gathered speed.&#160; The
air was full of last messages.&#160; Uncle John said
on second thoughts he wasn&#8217;t sure these Bocks
weren&#8217;t half a bad smoke after all.&#160; Gladys
Maud cried, because she had taken a sudden dislike
to the village idiot; and Mike settled himself in the
corner and opened a magazine.</p>

<p>He was alone in the carriage.&#160;
Bob, who had been spending the last week of the holidays
with an aunt further down the line, was to board the
train at East Wobsley, and the brothers were to make
a state entry into Wrykyn together.&#160; Meanwhile,
Mike was left to his milk chocolate, his magazines,
and his reflections.</p>

<p>The latter were not numerous, nor
profound.&#160; He was excited.&#160; He had been petitioning
the home authorities for the past year to be allowed
to leave his private school and go to Wrykyn, and now
the thing had come about.&#160; He wondered what sort
of a house Wain&#8217;s was, and whether they had
any chance of the cricket cup.&#160; According to Bob
they had no earthly; but then Bob only recognised
one house, Donaldson&#8217;s.&#160; He wondered if
Bob would get his first eleven cap this year, and if
he himself were likely to do anything at cricket.&#160;
Marjory had faithfully reported every word Saunders
had said on the subject, but Bob had been so careful
to point out his insignificance when compared with
the humblest Wrykynian that the professional&#8217;s
glowing prophecies had not had much effect.&#160; It
might be true that some day he would play for England,
but just at present he felt he would exchange his place
in the team for one in the Wrykyn third eleven.&#160;
A sort of mist enveloped everything Wrykynian.&#160;
It seemed almost hopeless to try and compete with
these unknown experts.&#160; On the other hand, there
was Bob.&#160; Bob, by all accounts, was on the verge
of the first eleven, and he was nothing special.</p>

<p>While he was engaged on these reflections,
the train drew up at a small station.&#160; Opposite
the door of Mike&#8217;s compartment was standing a
boy of about Mike&#8217;s size, though evidently some
years older.&#160; He had a sharp face, with rather
a prominent nose; and a pair of pince-nez gave him
a supercilious look.&#160; He wore a bowler hat, and
carried a small portmanteau.</p>

<p>He opened the door, and took the seat
opposite to Mike, whom he scrutinised for a moment
rather after the fashion of a naturalist examining
some new and unpleasant variety of beetle.&#160; He
seemed about to make some remark, but, instead, got
up and looked through the open window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s that porter?&#8221; Mike heard
him say.</p>

<p>The porter came skimming down the platform at that
moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Porter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are those frightful boxes of mine in all right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because, you know, there&#8217;ll
be a frightful row if any of them get lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No chance of that, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here you are, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The youth drew his head and shoulders
in, stared at Mike again, and finally sat down.&#160;
Mike noticed that he had nothing to read, and wondered
if he wanted anything; but he did not feel equal to
offering him one of his magazines.&#160; He did not
like the looks of him particularly.&#160; Judging by
appearances, he seemed to carry enough side for three.&#160;
If he wanted a magazine, thought Mike, let him ask
for it.</p>

<p>The other made no overtures, and at
the next stop got out.&#160; That explained his magazineless
condition.&#160; He was only travelling a short way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good business,&#8221; said
Mike to himself.&#160; He had all the Englishman&#8217;s
love of a carriage to himself.</p>

<p>The train was just moving out of the
station when his eye was suddenly caught by the stranger&#8217;s
bag, lying snugly in the rack.</p>

<p>And here, I regret to say, Mike acted
from the best motives, which is always fatal.</p>

<p>He realised in an instant what had
happened.&#160; The fellow had forgotten his bag.</p>

<p>Mike had not been greatly fascinated
by the stranger&#8217;s looks; but, after all, the
most supercilious person on earth has a right to his
own property.&#160; Besides, he might have been quite
a nice fellow when you got to know him.&#160; Anyhow,
the bag had better be returned at once.&#160; The train
was already moving quite fast, and Mike&#8217;s compartment
was nearing the end of the platform.</p>

<p>He snatched the bag from the rack
and hurled it out of the window.&#160; (Porter Robinson,
who happened to be in the line of fire, escaped with
a flesh wound.) Then he sat down again with the inward
glow of satisfaction which comes to one when one has
risen successfully to a sudden emergency.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>The glow lasted till the next stoppage,
which did not occur for a good many miles.&#160; Then
it ceased abruptly, for the train had scarcely come
to a standstill when the opening above the door was
darkened by a head and shoulders.&#160; The head was
surmounted by a bowler, and a pair of pince-nez gleamed
from the shadow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, I say,&#8221; said the
stranger.&#160; &#8220;Have you changed carriages, or
what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, dash it, where&#8217;s my frightful bag?&#8221;</p>

<p>Life teems with embarrassing situations.&#160; This
was one of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fact is,&#8221; said Mike, &#8220;I chucked
it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chucked it out! what do you mean?&#160; When?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At the last station.&#8221;</p>

<p>The guard blew his whistle, and the other jumped into
the carriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d got out
there for good,&#8221; explained Mike.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m
awfully sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where <i>is</i> the bag?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the platform at the last station.&#160; It
hit a porter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Against his will, for he wished to
treat the matter with fitting solemnity, Mike grinned
at the recollection.&#160; The look on Porter Robinson&#8217;s
face as the bag took him in the small of the back had
been funny, though not intentionally so.</p>

<p>The bereaved owner disapproved of this levity; and
said as much.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t <i>grin</i>, you
little beast,&#8221; he shouted.&#160; &#8220;There&#8217;s
nothing to laugh at.&#160; You go chucking bags that
don&#8217;t belong to you out of the window, and then
you have the frightful cheek to grin about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t that,&#8221;
said Mike hurriedly.&#160; &#8220;Only the porter looked
awfully funny when it hit him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dash the porter!&#160; What&#8217;s
going to happen about my bag?&#160; I can&#8217;t get
out for half a second to buy a magazine without your
flinging my things about the platform.&#160; What you
want is a frightful kicking.&#8221;</p>

<p>The situation was becoming difficult.&#160;
But fortunately at this moment the train stopped once
again; and, looking out of the window, Mike saw a
board with East Wobsley upon it in large letters.&#160;
A moment later Bob&#8217;s head appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, there you are,&#8221; said Bob.</p>

<p>His eye fell upon Mike&#8217;s companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, Gazeka!&#8221; he exclaimed.&#160;
&#8220;Where did you spring from?&#160; Do you know
my brother?&#160; He&#8217;s coming to Wrykyn this term.&#160;
By the way, rather lucky you&#8217;ve met.&#160; He&#8217;s
in your house.&#160; Firby-Smith&#8217;s head of Wain&#8217;s,
Mike.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike gathered that Gazeka and Firby-Smith
were one and the same person.&#160; He grinned again.&#160;
Firby-Smith continued to look ruffled, though not
aggressive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, are you in Wain&#8217;s?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Bob,&#8221; said Mike, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
made rather an ass of myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean, what happened was this.&#160;
I chucked Firby-Smith&#8217;s portmanteau out of the
window, thinking he&#8217;d got out, only he hadn&#8217;t
really, and it&#8217;s at a station miles back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a bit of a rotter,
aren&#8217;t you?&#160; Had it got your name and address
on it, Gazeka?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, then it&#8217;s certain
to be all right.&#160; It&#8217;s bound to turn up some
time.&#160; They&#8217;ll send it on by the next train,
and you&#8217;ll get it either to-night or to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Frightful nuisance, all the
same.&#160; Lots of things in it I wanted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, never mind, it&#8217;s
all right.&#160; I say, what have you been doing in
the holidays?&#160; I didn&#8217;t know you lived on
this line at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>From this point onwards Mike was out
of the conversation altogether.&#160; Bob and Firby-Smith
talked of Wrykyn, discussing events of the previous
term of which Mike had never heard.&#160; Names came
into their conversation which were entirely new to
him.&#160; He realised that school politics were being
talked, and that contributions from him to the dialogue
were not required.&#160; He took up his magazine again,
listening the while.&#160; They were discussing Wain&#8217;s
now.&#160; The name Wyatt cropped up with some frequency.&#160;
Wyatt was apparently something of a character.&#160;
Mention was made of rows in which he had played a part
in the past.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be pretty rotten for
him,&#8221; said Bob.&#160; &#8220;He and Wain never
get on very well, and yet they have to be together,
holidays as well as term.&#160; Pretty bad having a
step-father at all&#8212;&#173;I shouldn&#8217;t care
to&#8212;&#173;and when your house-master and your
step-father are the same man, it&#8217;s a bit thick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Frightful,&#8221; agreed Firby-Smith.</p>

<p>&#8220;I swear, if I were in Wyatt&#8217;s
place, I should rot about like anything.&#160; It isn&#8217;t
as if he&#8217;d anything to look forward to when he
leaves.&#160; He told me last term that Wain had got
a nomination for him in some beastly bank, and that
he was going into it directly after the end of this
term.&#160; Rather rough on a chap like Wyatt.&#160;
Good cricketer and footballer, I mean, and all that
sort of thing.&#160; It&#8217;s just the sort of life
he&#8217;ll hate most.&#160; Hullo, here we are.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike looked out of the window.&#160; It was Wrykyn
at last.</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch3">
CHAPTER III<br><br>
MIKE FINDS A FRIENDLY NATIVE</a></h3>

<p>Mike was surprised to find, on alighting,
that the platform was entirely free from Wrykynians.&#160;
In all the stories he had read the whole school came
back by the same train, and, having smashed in one
another&#8217;s hats and chaffed the porters, made
their way to the school buildings in a solid column.&#160;
But here they were alone.</p>

<p>A remark of Bob&#8217;s to Firby-Smith
explained this.&#160; &#8220;Can&#8217;t make out why
none of the fellows came back by this train,&#8221;
he said.&#160; &#8220;Heaps of them must come by this
line, and it&#8217;s the only Christian train they
run,&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t want to get here
before the last minute they can possibly manage.&#160;
Silly idea.&#160; I suppose they think there&#8217;d
be nothing to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall <i>we</i> do?&#8221;
said Bob.&#160; &#8220;Come and have some tea at Cook&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob looked at Mike.&#160; There was
no disguising the fact that he would be in the way;
but how convey this fact delicately to him?</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Mike,&#8221; he
said, with a happy inspiration, &#8220;Firby-Smith
and I are just going to get some tea.&#160; I think
you&#8217;d better nip up to the school.&#160; Probably
Wain will want to see you, and tell you all about
things, which is your dorm. and so on.&#160; See you
later,&#8221; he concluded airily.&#160; &#8220;Any
one&#8217;ll tell you the way to the school.&#160; Go
straight on.&#160; They&#8217;ll send your luggage
on later.&#160; So long.&#8221;&#160; And his sole prop
in this world of strangers departed, leaving him to
find his way for himself.</p>

<p>There is no subject on which opinions
differ so widely as this matter of finding the way
to a place.&#160; To the man who knows, it is simplicity
itself.&#160; Probably he really does imagine that he
goes straight on, ignoring the fact that for him the
choice of three roads, all more or less straight,
has no perplexities.&#160; The man who does not know
feels as if he were in a maze.</p>

<p>Mike started out boldly, and lost
his way.&#160; Go in which direction he would, he always
seemed to arrive at a square with a fountain and an
equestrian statue in its centre.&#160; On the fourth
repetition of this feat he stopped in a disheartened
way, and looked about him.&#160; He was beginning to
feel bitter towards Bob.&#160; The man might at least
have shown him where to get some tea.</p>

<p>At this moment a ray of hope shone
through the gloom.&#160; Crossing the square was a
short, thick-set figure clad in grey flannel trousers,
a blue blazer, and a straw hat with a coloured band.&#160;
Plainly a Wrykynian.&#160; Mike made for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you tell me the way to
the school, please,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re going to the
school,&#8221; said the other.&#160; He had a pleasant,
square-jawed face, reminiscent of a good-tempered bull-dog,
and a pair of very deep-set grey eyes which somehow
put Mike at his ease.&#160; There was something singularly
cool and genial about them.&#160; He felt that they
saw the humour in things, and that their owner was
a person who liked most people and whom most people
liked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look rather lost,&#8221;
said the stranger.&#160; &#8220;Been hunting for it
long?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which house do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wain&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wain&#8217;s?&#160; Then you&#8217;ve
come to the right man this time.&#160; What I don&#8217;t
know about Wain&#8217;s isn&#8217;t worth knowing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you there, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I not!&#160; Term <i>and</i> holidays.&#160;
There&#8217;s no close season for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, are you Wyatt, then?&#8221; asked Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, this is fame.&#160; How
did you know my name, as the ass in the detective
story always says to the detective, who&#8217;s seen
it in the lining of his hat?&#160; Who&#8217;s been
talking about me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard my brother saying something about you
in the train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s your brother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jackson.&#160; He&#8217;s in Donaldson&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know.&#160; A stout fellow.&#160;
So you&#8217;re the newest make of Jackson, latest
model, with all the modern improvements?&#160; Are there
any more of you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not brothers,&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pity.&#160; You can&#8217;t
quite raise a team, then?&#160; Are you a sort of young
Tyldesley, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I played a bit at my last school.&#160;
Only a private school, you know,&#8221; added Mike
modestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make any runs?&#160; What was your best score?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hundred and twenty-three,&#8221;
said Mike awkwardly.&#160; &#8220;It was only against
kids, you know.&#8221;&#160; He was in terror lest he
should seem to be bragging.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s pretty useful.&#160; Any more centuries?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mike, shuffling.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seven altogether.&#160; You
know, it was really awfully rotten bowling.&#160; And
I was a good bit bigger than most of the chaps there.&#160;
And my pater always has a pro. down in the Easter
holidays, which gave me a bit of an advantage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the same, seven centuries
isn&#8217;t so dusty against any bowling.&#160; We
shall want some batting in the house this term.&#160;
Look here, I was just going to have some tea.&#160;
You come along, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thanks awfully,&#8221;
said Mike.&#160; &#8220;My brother and Firby-Smith have
gone to a place called Cook&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The old Gazeka?&#160; I didn&#8217;t
know he lived in your part of the world.&#160; He&#8217;s
head of Wain&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; said Mike.&#160;
&#8220;Why is he called Gazeka?&#8221; he asked after
a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think he looks
like one?&#160; What did you think of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t speak to him
much,&#8221; said Mike cautiously.&#160; It is always
delicate work answering a question like this unless
one has some sort of an inkling as to the views of
the questioner.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s all right,&#8221;
said Wyatt, answering for himself.&#160; &#8220;He&#8217;s
got a habit of talking to one as if he were a prince
of the blood dropping a gracious word to one of the
three Small-Heads at the Hippodrome, but that&#8217;s
his misfortune.&#160; We all have our troubles.&#160;
That&#8217;s his.&#160; Let&#8217;s go in here.&#160;
It&#8217;s too far to sweat to Cook&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was about a mile from the tea-shop
to the school.&#160; Mike&#8217;s first impression
on arriving at the school grounds was of his smallness
and insignificance.&#160; Everything looked so big&#8212;&#173;the
buildings, the grounds, everything.&#160; He felt out
of the picture.&#160; He was glad that he had met Wyatt.&#160;
To make his entrance into this strange land alone would
have been more of an ordeal than he would have cared
to face.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Wain&#8217;s,&#8221;
said Wyatt, pointing to one of half a dozen large
houses which lined the road on the south side of the
cricket field.&#160; Mike followed his finger, and
took in the size of his new home.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, it&#8217;s jolly big,&#8221;
he said.&#160; &#8220;How many fellows are there in
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thirty-one this term, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s more than there were at King-Hall&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s King-Hall&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The private school I was at.&#160; At Emsworth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Emsworth seemed very remote and unreal to him as he
spoke.</p>

<p>They skirted the cricket field, walking
along the path that divided the two terraces.&#160;
The Wrykyn playing-fields were formed of a series of
huge steps, cut out of the hill.&#160; At the top of
the hill came the school.&#160; On the first terrace
was a sort of informal practice ground, where, though
no games were played on it, there was a good deal of
punting and drop-kicking in the winter and fielding-practice
in the summer.&#160; The next terrace was the biggest
of all, and formed the first eleven cricket ground,
a beautiful piece of turf, a shade too narrow for
its length, bounded on the terrace side by a sharply
sloping bank, some fifteen feet deep, and on the other
by the precipice leading to the next terrace.&#160;
At the far end of the ground stood the pavilion, and
beside it a little ivy-covered rabbit-hutch for the
scorers.&#160; Old Wrykynians always claimed that it
was the prettiest school ground in England.&#160; It
certainly had the finest view.&#160; From the verandah
of the pavilion you could look over three counties.</p>

<p>Wain&#8217;s house wore an empty and
desolate appearance.&#160; There were signs of activity,
however, inside; and a smell of soap and warm water
told of preparations recently completed.</p>

<p>Wyatt took Mike into the matron&#8217;s
room, a small room opening out of the main passage.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Jackson,&#8221; he
said.&#160; &#8220;Which dormitory is he in, Miss Payne?&#8221;</p>

<p>The matron consulted a paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s in yours, Wyatt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good business.&#160; Who&#8217;s
in the other bed?&#160; There are going to be three
of us, aren&#8217;t there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fereira was to have slept there,
but we have just heard that he is not coming back
this term.&#160; He has had to go on a sea-voyage for
his health.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems queer any one actually
taking the trouble to keep Fereira in the world,&#8221;
said Wyatt.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;ve often thought of
giving him Rough On Rats myself.&#160; Come along,
Jackson, and I&#8217;ll show you the room.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went along the passage, and up a flight of stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here you are,&#8221; said Wyatt.</p>

<p>It was a fair-sized room.&#160; The
window, heavily barred, looked out over a large garden.</p>

<p>&#8220;I used to sleep here alone
last term,&#8221; said Wyatt, &#8220;but the house
is so full now they&#8217;ve turned it into a dormitory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, I wish these bars weren&#8217;t
here.&#160; It would be rather a rag to get out of
the window on to that wall at night, and hop down into
the garden and explore,&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>Wyatt looked at him curiously, and moved to the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to let
you do it, of course,&#8221; he said, &#8220;because
you&#8217;d go getting caught, and dropped on, which
isn&#8217;t good for one in one&#8217;s first term;
but just to amuse you&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>He jerked at the middle bar, and the
next moment he was standing with it in his hand, and
the way to the garden was clear.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s simply an object-lesson,
you know,&#8221; said Wyatt, replacing the bar, and
pushing the screws back into their putty.&#160; &#8220;I
get out at night myself because I think my health
needs it.&#160; Besides, it&#8217;s my last term, anyhow,
so it doesn&#8217;t matter what I do.&#160; But if I
find you trying to cut out in the small hours, there&#8217;ll
be trouble.&#160; See?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Mike,
reluctantly.&#160; &#8220;But I wish you&#8217;d let
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if I know it.&#160; Promise you won&#8217;t
try it on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right.&#160; But, I say, what do you do
out there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shoot at cats with an air-pistol,
the beauty of which is that even if you hit them it
doesn&#8217;t hurt&#8212;&#173;simply keeps them bright
and interested in life; and if you miss you&#8217;ve
had all the fun anyhow.&#160; Have you ever shot at
a rocketing cat?&#160; Finest mark you can have.&#160;
Society&#8217;s latest craze.&#160; Buy a pistol and
see life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you&#8217;d let me come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I daresay you do.&#160; Not
much, however.&#160; Now, if you like, I&#8217;ll take
you over the rest of the school.&#160; You&#8217;ll
have to see it sooner or later, so you may as well
get it over at once.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch4">
CHAPTER IV<br><br>
AT THE NETS</a></h3>

<p>There are few better things in life
than a public school summer term.&#160; The winter
term is good, especially towards the end, and there
are points, though not many, about the Easter term:&#160;
but it is in the summer that one really appreciates
public school life.&#160; The freedom of it, after
the restrictions of even the most easy-going private
school, is intoxicating.&#160; The change is almost
as great as that from public school to &#8217;Varsity.</p>

<p>For Mike the path was made particularly
easy.&#160; The only drawback to going to a big school
for the first time is the fact that one is made to
feel so very small and inconspicuous.&#160; New boys
who have been leading lights at their private schools
feel it acutely for the first week.&#160; At one time
it was the custom, if we may believe writers of a
generation or so back, for boys to take quite an embarrassing
interest in the newcomer.&#160; He was asked a rain
of questions, and was, generally, in the very centre
of the stage.&#160; Nowadays an absolute lack of interest
is the fashion.&#160; A new boy arrives, and there he
is, one of a crowd.</p>

<p>Mike was saved this salutary treatment
to a large extent, at first by virtue of the greatness
of his family, and, later, by his own performances
on the cricket field.&#160; His three elder brothers
were objects of veneration to most Wrykynians, and
Mike got a certain amount of reflected glory from
them.&#160; The brother of first-class cricketers has
a dignity of his own.&#160; Then Bob was a help.&#160;
He was on the verge of the cricket team and had been
the school full-back for two seasons.&#160; Mike found
that people came up and spoke to him, anxious to know
if he were Jackson&#8217;s brother; and became friendly
when he replied in the affirmative.&#160; Influential
relations are a help in every stage of life.</p>

<p>It was Wyatt who gave him his first
chance at cricket.&#160; There were nets on the first
afternoon of term for all old colours of the three
teams and a dozen or so of those most likely to fill
the vacant places.&#160; Wyatt was there, of course.&#160;
He had got his first eleven cap in the previous season
as a mighty hitter and a fair slow bowler.&#160; Mike
met him crossing the field with his cricket bag.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, where are you off to?&#8221;
asked Wyatt.&#160; &#8220;Coming to watch the nets?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike had no particular programme for
the afternoon.&#160; Junior cricket had not begun,
and it was a little difficult to know how to fill in
the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you what,&#8221; said
Wyatt, &#8220;nip into the house and shove on some
things, and I&#8217;ll try and get Burgess to let you
have a knock later on.&#8221;</p>

<p>This suited Mike admirably.&#160; A
quarter of an hour later he was sitting at the back
of the first eleven net, watching the practice.</p>

<p>Burgess, the captain of the Wrykyn
team, made no pretence of being a bat.&#160; He was
the school fast bowler and concentrated his energies
on that department of the game.&#160; He sometimes
took ten minutes at the wicket after everybody else
had had an innings, but it was to bowl that he came
to the nets.</p>

<p>He was bowling now to one of the old
colours whose name Mike did not know.&#160; Wyatt and
one of the professionals were the other two bowlers.&#160;
Two nets away Firby-Smith, who had changed his pince-nez
for a pair of huge spectacles, was performing rather
ineffectively against some very bad bowling.&#160;
Mike fixed his attention on the first eleven man.</p>

<p>He was evidently a good bat.&#160;
There was style and power in his batting.&#160; He
had a way of gliding Burgess&#8217;s fastest to leg
which Mike admired greatly.&#160; He was succeeded
at the end of a quarter of an hour by another eleven
man, and then Bob appeared.</p>

<p>It was soon made evident that this
was not Bob&#8217;s day.&#160; Nobody is at his best
on the first day of term; but Bob was worse than he
had any right to be.&#160; He scratched forward at
nearly everything, and when Burgess, who had been
resting, took up the ball again, he had each stump
uprooted in a regular series in seven balls.&#160; Once
he skied one of Wyatt&#8217;s slows over the net behind
the wicket; and Mike, jumping up, caught him neatly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Bob austerely,
as Mike returned the ball to him.&#160; He seemed depressed.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the afternoon,
Wyatt went up to Burgess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Burgess,&#8221; he said, &#8220;see
that kid sitting behind the net?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With the naked eye,&#8221; said Burgess.&#160;
&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s just come to Wain&#8217;s.&#160;
He&#8217;s Bob Jackson&#8217;s brother, and I&#8217;ve
a sort of idea that he&#8217;s a bit of a bat.&#160;
I told him I&#8217;d ask you if he could have a knock.&#160;
Why not send him in at the end net?&#160; There&#8217;s
nobody there now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Burgess&#8217;s amiability off the
field equalled his ruthlessness when bowling.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said.&#160;
&#8220;Only if you think that I&#8217;m going to sweat
to bowl to him, you&#8217;re making a fatal error.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t do a thing.&#160;
Just sit and watch.&#160; I rather fancy this kid&#8217;s
something special.&#8221;</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>Mike put on Wyatt&#8217;s pads and
gloves, borrowed his bat, and walked round into the
net.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in a funk, are you?&#8221; asked Wyatt,
as he passed.</p>

<p>Mike grinned.&#160; The fact was that
he had far too good an opinion of himself to be nervous.&#160;
An entirely modest person seldom makes a good batsman.&#160;
Batting is one of those things which demand first and
foremost a thorough belief in oneself.&#160; It need
not be aggressive, but it must be there.</p>

<p>Wyatt and the professional were the
bowlers.&#160; Mike had seen enough of Wyatt&#8217;s
bowling to know that it was merely ordinary &#8220;slow
tosh,&#8221; and the professional did not look as
difficult as Saunders.&#160; The first half-dozen balls
he played carefully.&#160; He was on trial, and he meant
to take no risks.&#160; Then the professional over-pitched
one slightly on the off.&#160; Mike jumped out, and
got the full face of the bat on to it.&#160; The ball
hit one of the ropes of the net, and nearly broke it.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221; said
Wyatt, with the smile of an impresario on the first
night of a successful piece.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not bad,&#8221; admitted Burgess.</p>

<p>A few moments later he was still more
complimentary.&#160; He got up and took a ball himself.</p>

<p>Mike braced himself up as Burgess
began his run.&#160; This time he was more than a trifle
nervous.&#160; The bowling he had had so far had been
tame.&#160; This would be the real ordeal.</p>

<p>As the ball left Burgess&#8217;s hand
he began instinctively to shape for a forward stroke.&#160;
Then suddenly he realised that the thing was going
to be a yorker, and banged his bat down in the block
just as the ball arrived.&#160; An unpleasant sensation
as of having been struck by a thunderbolt was succeeded
by a feeling of relief that he had kept the ball out
of his wicket.&#160; There are easier things in the
world than stopping a fast yorker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well played,&#8221; said Burgess.</p>

<p>Mike felt like a successful general
receiving the thanks of the nation.</p>

<p>The fact that Burgess&#8217;s next
ball knocked middle and off stumps out of the ground
saddened him somewhat; but this was the last tragedy
that occurred.&#160; He could not do much with the
bowling beyond stopping it and feeling repetitions
of the thunderbolt experience, but he kept up his
end; and a short conversation which he had with Burgess
at the end of his innings was full of encouragement
to one skilled in reading between the lines.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks awfully,&#8221; said
Mike, referring to the square manner in which the
captain had behaved in letting him bat.</p>

<p>&#8220;What school were you at before
you came here?&#8221; asked Burgess.</p>

<p>&#8220;A private school in Hampshire,&#8221;
said Mike.&#160; &#8220;King-Hall&#8217;s.&#160; At a
place called Emsworth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get much cricket there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a good lot.&#160; One of
the masters, a chap called Westbrook, was an awfully
good slow bowler.&#8221;</p>

<p>Burgess nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t run away, which is something,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>Mike turned purple with pleasure at
this stately compliment.&#160; Then, having waited
for further remarks, but gathering from the captain&#8217;s
silence that the audience was at an end, he proceeded
to unbuckle his pads.&#160; Wyatt overtook him on his
way to the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well played,&#8221; he said.&#160;
&#8220;I&#8217;d no idea you were such hot stuff.&#160;
You&#8217;re a regular pro.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; said Mike gratefully,
&#8220;it was most awfully decent of you getting Burgess
to let me go in.&#160; It was simply ripping of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right.&#160;
If you don&#8217;t get pushed a bit here you stay for
ages in the hundredth game with the cripples and the
kids.&#160; Now you&#8217;ve shown them what you can
do you ought to get into the Under Sixteen team straight
away.&#160; Probably into the third, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, that would be all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked Burgess afterwards
what he thought of your batting, and he said, &#8216;Not
bad.&#8217;&#160; But he says that about everything.&#160;
It&#8217;s his highest form of praise.&#160; He says
it when he wants to let himself go and simply butter
up a thing.&#160; If you took him to see N. A. Knox
bowl, he&#8217;d say he wasn&#8217;t bad.&#160; What
he meant was that he was jolly struck with your batting,
and is going to play you for the Under Sixteen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>The prophecy was fulfilled.&#160; On
the following Wednesday there was a match between
the Under Sixteen and a scratch side.&#160; Mike&#8217;s
name was among the Under Sixteen.&#160; And on the
Saturday he was playing for the third eleven in a
trial game.</p>

<p>&#8220;This place is ripping,&#8221;
he said to himself, as he saw his name on the list.&#160;
&#8220;Thought I should like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>And that night he wrote a letter to
his father, notifying him of the fact.</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch5">
CHAPTER V<br><br>
REVELRY BY NIGHT</a></h3>

<p>A succession of events combined to
upset Mike during his first fortnight at school.&#160;
He was far more successful than he had any right to
be at his age.&#160; There is nothing more heady than
success, and if it comes before we are prepared for
it, it is apt to throw us off our balance.&#160; As
a rule, at school, years of wholesome obscurity make
us ready for any small triumphs we may achieve at
the end of our time there.&#160; Mike had skipped these
years.&#160; He was older than the average new boy,
and his batting was undeniable.&#160; He knew quite
well that he was regarded as a find by the cricket
authorities; and the knowledge was not particularly
good for him.&#160; It did not make him conceited, for
his was not a nature at all addicted to conceit.&#160;
The effect it had on him was to make him excessively
pleased with life.&#160; And when Mike was pleased
with life he always found a difficulty in obeying Authority
and its rules.&#160; His state of mind was not improved
by an interview with Bob.</p>

<p>Some evil genius put it into Bob&#8217;s
mind that it was his duty to be, if only for one performance,
the Heavy Elder Brother to Mike; to give him good
advice.&#160; It is never the smallest use for an elder
brother to attempt to do anything for the good of
a younger brother at school, for the latter rebels
automatically against such interference in his concerns;
but Bob did not know this.&#160; He only knew that he
had received a letter from home, in which his mother
had assumed without evidence that he was leading Mike
by the hand round the pitfalls of life at Wrykyn;
and his conscience smote him.&#160; Beyond asking him
occasionally, when they met, how he was getting on
(a question to which Mike invariably replied, &#8220;Oh,
all right"), he was not aware of having done anything
brotherly towards the youngster.&#160; So he asked Mike
to tea in his study one afternoon before going to
the nets.</p>

<p>Mike arrived, sidling into the study
in the half-sheepish, half-defiant manner peculiar
to small brothers in the presence of their elders,
and stared in silence at the photographs on the walls.&#160;
Bob was changing into his cricket things.&#160; The
atmosphere was one of constraint and awkwardness.</p>

<p>The arrival of tea was the cue for conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, how are you getting on?&#8221; asked
Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, all right,&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sugar?&#8221; asked Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many lumps?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cake?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>Bob pulled himself together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like Wain&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ripping.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked Firby-Smith to keep an eye on you,&#8221;
said Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>The mere idea of a worm like the Gazeka
being told to keep an eye on <i>him</i> was degrading.</p>

<p>&#8220;He said he&#8217;d look after you,&#8221; added
Bob, making things worse.</p>

<p>Look after him!&#160; Him!!&#160; M. Jackson, of the
third eleven!!!</p>

<p>Mike helped himself to another chunk of cake, and
spoke crushingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He needn&#8217;t trouble,&#8221;
he said.&#160; &#8220;I can look after myself all right,
thanks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob saw an opening for the entry of the Heavy Elder
Brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Mike,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m
only saying it for your good&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>I should like to state here that it
was not Bob&#8217;s habit to go about the world telling
people things solely for their good.&#160; He was only
doing it now to ease his conscience.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; said Mike coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only this.&#160;
You know, I should keep an eye on myself if I were
you.&#160; There&#8217;s nothing that gets a chap so
barred here as side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; said Mike, outraged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not saying anything
against you so far,&#8221; said Bob.&#160; &#8220;You&#8217;ve
been all right up to now.&#160; What I mean to say is,
you&#8217;ve got on so well at cricket, in the third
and so on, there&#8217;s just a chance you might start
to side about a bit soon, if you don&#8217;t watch
yourself.&#160; I&#8217;m not saying a word against
you so far, of course.&#160; Only you see what I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike&#8217;s feelings were too deep
for words.&#160; In sombre silence he reached out for
the jam; while Bob, satisfied that he had delivered
his message in a pleasant and tactful manner, filled
his cup, and cast about him for further words of wisdom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seen you about with Wyatt a
good deal,&#8221; he said at length.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mike cautiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; said Bob,
&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t&#8212;&#173;I mean, I should
take care what you&#8217;re doing with Wyatt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s an awfully good chap, of course,
but still&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I mean, he&#8217;s the
sort of chap who&#8217;ll probably get into some thundering
row before he leaves.&#160; He doesn&#8217;t care a
hang what he does.&#160; He&#8217;s that sort of chap.&#160;
He&#8217;s never been dropped on yet, but if you go
on breaking rules you&#8217;re bound to be sooner or
later.&#160; Thing is, it doesn&#8217;t matter much
for him, because he&#8217;s leaving at the end of the
term.&#160; But don&#8217;t let him drag you into anything.&#160;
Not that he would try to.&#160; But you might think
it was the blood thing to do to imitate him, and the
first thing you knew you&#8217;d be dropped on by Wain
or somebody.&#160; See what I mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob was well-intentioned, but tact
did not enter greatly into his composition.</p>

<p>&#8220;What rot!&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right.&#160; But don&#8217;t
you go doing it.&#160; I&#8217;m going over to the nets.&#160;
I see Burgess has shoved you down for them.&#160; You&#8217;d
better be going and changing.&#160; Stick on here a
bit, though, if you want any more tea.&#160; I&#8217;ve
got to be off myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike changed for net-practice in a
ferment of spiritual injury.&#160; It was maddening
to be treated as an infant who had to be looked after.&#160;
He felt very sore against Bob.</p>

<p>A good innings at the third eleven
net, followed by some strenuous fielding in the deep,
soothed his ruffled feelings to a large extent; and
all might have been well but for the intervention of
Firby-Smith.</p>

<p>That youth, all spectacles and front
teeth, met Mike at the door of Wain&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I wanted to see you, young
man,&#8221; he said. (Mike disliked being called &#8220;young
man.&#8221;) &#8220;Come up to my study.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike followed him in silence to his
study, and preserved his silence till Firby-Smith,
having deposited his cricket-bag in a corner of the
room and examined himself carefully in a looking-glass
that hung over the mantelpiece, spoke again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been hearing all
about you, young man.&#8221;&#160; Mike shuffled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a frightful character
from all accounts.&#8221;&#160; Mike could not think
of anything to say that was not rude, so said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your brother has asked me to keep an eye on
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike&#8217;s soul began to tie itself
into knots again.&#160; He was just at the age when
one is most sensitive to patronage and most resentful
of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I promised I would,&#8221;
said the Gazeka, turning round and examining himself
in the mirror again.&#160; &#8220;You&#8217;ll get on
all right if you behave yourself.&#160; Don&#8217;t
make a frightful row in the house.&#160; Don&#8217;t
cheek your elders and betters.&#160; Wash.&#160; That&#8217;s
all.&#160; Cut along.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike had a vague idea of sacrificing
his career to the momentary pleasure of flinging a
chair at the head of the house.&#160; Overcoming this
feeling, he walked out of the room, and up to his dormitory
to change.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>In the dormitory that night the feeling
of revolt, of wanting to do something actively illegal,
increased.&#160; Like Eric, he burned, not with shame
and remorse, but with rage and all that sort of thing.&#160;
He dropped off to sleep full of half-formed plans for
asserting himself.&#160; He was awakened from a dream
in which he was batting against Firby-Smith&#8217;s
bowling, and hitting it into space every time, by a
slight sound.&#160; He opened his eyes, and saw a dark
figure silhouetted against the light of the window.&#160;
He sat up in bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo,&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;Is that
you, Wyatt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you awake?&#8221; said
Wyatt.&#160; &#8220;Sorry if I&#8217;ve spoiled your
beauty sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; said Wyatt.&#160;
&#8220;The cats are particularly strong on the wing
just now.&#160; Mustn&#8217;t miss a chance like this.&#160;
Specially as there&#8217;s a good moon, too.&#160;
I shall be deadly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, can&#8217;t I come too?&#8221;</p>

<p>A moonlight prowl, with or without
an air-pistol, would just have suited Mike&#8217;s
mood.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you can&#8217;t,&#8221;
said Wyatt.&#160; &#8220;When I&#8217;m caught, as I&#8217;m
morally certain to be some day, or night rather, they&#8217;re
bound to ask if you&#8217;ve ever been out as well
as me.&#160; Then you&#8217;ll be able to put your hand
on your little heart and do a big George Washington
act.&#160; You&#8217;ll find that useful when the time
comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think you will be caught?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t be surprised.&#160;
Anyhow, you stay where you are.&#160; Go to sleep and
dream that you&#8217;re playing for the school against
Ripton.&#160; So long.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Wyatt, laying the bar he had extracted
on the window-sill, wriggled out.&#160; Mike saw him
disappearing along the wall.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">


<p>It was all very well for Wyatt to
tell him to go to sleep, but it was not so easy to
do it.&#160; The room was almost light; and Mike always
found it difficult to sleep unless it was dark.&#160;
He turned over on his side and shut his eyes, but
he had never felt wider awake.&#160; Twice he heard
the quarters chime from the school clock; and the second
time he gave up the struggle.&#160; He got out of bed
and went to the window.&#160; It was a lovely night,
just the sort of night on which, if he had been at
home, he would have been out after moths with a lantern.</p>

<p>A sharp yowl from an unseen cat told
of Wyatt&#8217;s presence somewhere in the big garden.&#160;
He would have given much to be with him, but he realised
that he was on parole.&#160; He had promised not to
leave the house, and there was an end of it.</p>

<p>He turned away from the window and
sat down on his bed.&#160; Then a beautiful, consoling
thought came to him.&#160; He had given his word that
he would not go into the garden, but nothing had been
said about exploring inside the house.&#160; It was
quite late now.&#160; Everybody would be in bed.&#160;
It would be quite safe.&#160; And there must be all
sorts of things to interest the visitor in Wain&#8217;s
part of the house.&#160; Food, perhaps.&#160; Mike felt
that he could just do with a biscuit.&#160; And there
were bound to be biscuits on the sideboard in Wain&#8217;s
dining-room.</p>

<p>He crept quietly out of the dormitory.</p>

<p>He had been long enough in the house
to know the way, in spite of the fact that all was
darkness.&#160; Down the stairs, along the passage to
the left, and up a few more stairs at the end. The
beauty of the position was that the dining-room had
two doors, one leading into Wain&#8217;s part of the
house, the other into the boys&#8217; section.&#160;
Any interruption that there might be would come from
the further door.</p>

<p>To make himself more secure he locked
that door; then, turning up the incandescent light,
he proceeded to look about him.</p>

<p>Mr. Wain&#8217;s dining-room repaid
inspection.&#160; There were the remains of supper
on the table.&#160; Mike cut himself some cheese and
took some biscuits from the box, feeling that he was
doing himself well.&#160; This was Life.&#160; There
was a little soda-water in the syphon.&#160; He finished
it.&#160; As it swished into the glass, it made a noise
that seemed to him like three hundred Niagaras; but
nobody else in the house appeared to have noticed
it.</p>

<p>He took some more biscuits, and an apple.</p>

<p>After which, feeling a new man, he examined the room.</p>

<p>And this was where the trouble began.</p>

<p>On a table in one corner stood a small
gramophone.&#160; And gramophones happened to be Mike&#8217;s
particular craze.</p>

<p>All thought of risk left him.&#160;
The soda-water may have got into his head, or he may
have been in a particularly reckless mood, as indeed
he was.&#160; The fact remains that <i>he</i> inserted
the first record that came to hand, wound the machine
up, and set it going.</p>

<p>The next moment, very loud and nasal,
a voice from the machine announced that Mr. Godfrey
Field would sing &#8220;The Quaint Old Bird.&#8221;&#160;
And, after a few preliminary chords, Mr. Field actually
did so.</p>

<p><i>"Auntie went to Aldershot in a Paris pom-pom hat."</i></p>

<p>Mike stood and drained it in.</p>

<p><i>"...&#160; Good gracious</i> (sang
Mr. Field), <i>what was that?"</i></p>

<p>It was a rattling at the handle of
the door.&#160; A rattling that turned almost immediately
into a spirited banging.&#160; A voice accompanied the
banging.&#160; &#8220;Who is there?&#8221; inquired
the voice.&#160; Mike recognised it as Mr. Wain&#8217;s.&#160;
He was not alarmed.&#160; The man who holds the ace
of trumps has no need to be alarmed.&#160; His position
was impregnable.&#160; The enemy was held in check
by the locked door, while the other door offered an
admirable and instantaneous way of escape.</p>

<p>Mike crept across the room on tip-toe
and opened the window.&#160; It had occurred to him,
just in time, that if Mr. Wain, on entering the room,
found that the occupant had retired by way of the boys&#8217;
part of the house, he might possibly obtain a clue
to his identity.&#160; If, on the other hand, he opened
the window, suspicion would be diverted.&#160; Mike
had not read his &#8220;Raffles&#8221; for nothing.</p>

<p>The handle-rattling was resumed.&#160;
This was good.&#160; So long as the frontal attack
was kept up, there was no chance of his being taken
in the rear&#8212;&#173;his only danger.</p>

<p>He stopped the gramophone, which had
been pegging away patiently at &#8220;The Quaint Old
Bird&#8221; all the time, and reflected.&#160; It seemed
a pity to evacuate the position and ring down the
curtain on what was, to date, the most exciting episode
of his life; but he must not overdo the thing, and
get caught.&#160; At any moment the noise might bring
reinforcements to the besieging force, though it was
not likely, for the dining-room was a long way from
the dormitories; and it might flash upon their minds
that there were two entrances to the room.&#160; Or
the same bright thought might come to Wain himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now what,&#8221; pondered Mike,
&#8220;would A. J. Raffles have done in a case like
this?&#160; Suppose he&#8217;d been after somebody&#8217;s
jewels, and found that they were after him, and he&#8217;d
locked one door, and could get away by the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>The answer was simple.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d clear out,&#8221; thought Mike.</p>

<p>Two minutes later he was in bed.</p>

<p>He lay there, tingling all over with
the consciousness of having played a masterly game,
when suddenly a gruesome idea came to him, and he
sat up, breathless.&#160; Suppose Wain took it into
his head to make a tour of the dormitories, to see
that all was well!&#160; Wyatt was still in the garden
somewhere, blissfully unconscious of what was going
on indoors.&#160; He would be caught for a certainty!</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch6">
CHAPTER VI<br><br>
IN WHICH A TIGHT CORNER IS EVADED</a></h3>

<p>For a moment the situation paralysed
Mike.&#160; Then he began to be equal to it.&#160; In
times of excitement one thinks rapidly and clearly.&#160;
The main point, the kernel of the whole thing, was
that he must get into the garden somehow, and warn
Wyatt.&#160; And at the same time, he must keep Mr.
Wain from coming to the dormitory.&#160; He jumped out
of bed, and dashed down the dark stairs.</p>

<p>He had taken care to close the dining-room
door after him.&#160; It was open now, and he could
hear somebody moving inside the room.&#160; Evidently
his retreat had been made just in time.</p>

<p>He knocked at the door, and went in.</p>

<p>Mr. Wain was standing at the window,
looking out.&#160; He spun round at the knock, and
stared in astonishment at Mike&#8217;s pyjama-clad
figure.&#160; Mike, in spite of his anxiety, could
barely check a laugh.&#160; Mr. Wain was a tall, thin
man, with a serious face partially obscured by a grizzled
beard.&#160; He wore spectacles, through which he peered
owlishly at Mike.&#160; His body was wrapped in a brown
dressing-gown.&#160; His hair was ruffled.&#160; He
looked like some weird bird.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir, I thought I heard a noise,&#8221;
said Mike.</p>

<p>Mr. Wain continued to stare.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221; said he at
last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thought I heard a noise, please, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A noise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir, a row.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You thought you heard&#8212;&#8212;!&#8221;</p>

<p>The thing seemed to be worrying Mr. Wain.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I came down, sir,&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>The house-master&#8217;s giant brain
still appeared to be somewhat clouded.&#160; He looked
about him, and, catching sight of the gramophone, drew
inspiration from it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you turn on the gramophone?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Me</i>, sir!&#8221; said
Mike, with the air of a bishop accused of contributing
to the <i>Police News</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not, of course not,&#8221;
said Mr. Wain hurriedly.&#160; &#8220;Of course not.&#160;
I don&#8217;t know why I asked.&#160; All this is very
unsettling.&#160; What are you doing here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thought I heard a noise, please, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A noise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A row, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>If it was Mr. Wain&#8217;s wish that
he should spend the night playing Massa Tambo to his
Massa Bones, it was not for him to baulk the house-master&#8217;s
innocent pleasure.&#160; He was prepared to continue
the snappy dialogue till breakfast time.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think there must have been a burglar in here,
Jackson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like it, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I found the window open.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s probably in the garden, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Wain looked out into the garden
with an annoyed expression, as if its behaviour in
letting burglars be in it struck him as unworthy of
a respectable garden.</p>

<p>&#8220;He might be still in the house,&#8221; said
Mr. Wain, ruminatively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not likely, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t be such a fool, sir.&#160; I
mean, such an ass, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you are right, Jackson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t wonder if he was hiding in
the shrubbery, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Wain looked at the shrubbery,
as who should say, <i>"Et tu, Brute!"</i></p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#160; I think I see
him,&#8221; cried Mike.&#160; He ran to the window,
and vaulted through it on to the lawn.&#160; An inarticulate
protest from Mr. Wain, rendered speechless by this
move just as he had been beginning to recover his
faculties, and he was running across the lawn into
the shrubbery.&#160; He felt that all was well.&#160;
There might be a bit of a row on his return, but he
could always plead overwhelming excitement.</p>

<p>Wyatt was round at the back somewhere,
and the problem was how to get back without being
seen from the dining-room window.&#160; Fortunately
a belt of evergreens ran along the path right up to
the house.&#160; Mike worked his way cautiously through
these till he was out of sight, then tore for the
regions at the back.</p>

<p>The moon had gone behind the clouds,
and it was not easy to find a way through the bushes.&#160;
Twice branches sprang out from nowhere, and hit Mike
smartly over the shins, eliciting sharp howls of pain.</p>

<p>On the second of these occasions a
low voice spoke from somewhere on his right.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who on earth&#8217;s that?&#8221; it said.</p>

<p>Mike stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that you, Wyatt?&#160; I say&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jackson!&#8221;</p>

<p>The moon came out again, and Mike
saw Wyatt clearly.&#160; His knees were covered with
mould.&#160; He had evidently been crouching in the
bushes on all fours.</p>

<p>&#8220;You young ass,&#8221; said
Wyatt.&#160; &#8220;You promised me that you wouldn&#8217;t
get out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know, but&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard you crashing through
the shrubbery like a hundred elephants.&#160; If you
<i>must</i> get out at night and chance being sacked,
you might at least have the sense to walk quietly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but you don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Mike rapidly explained the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how the dickens did he
hear you, if you were in the dining-room?&#8221; asked
Wyatt.&#160; &#8220;It&#8217;s miles from his bedroom.&#160;
You must tread like a policeman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t that.&#160;
The thing was, you see, it was rather a rotten thing
to do, I suppose, but I turned on the gramophone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8212;&#173;<i>what?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The gramophone.&#160; It started
playing &#8216;The Quaint Old Bird.&#8217;&#160; Ripping
it was, till Wain came along.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wyatt doubled up with noiseless laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a genius,&#8221;
he said.&#160; &#8220;I never saw such a man.&#160; Well,
what&#8217;s the game now?&#160; What&#8217;s the idea?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;d better
nip back along the wall and in through the window,
and I&#8217;ll go back to the dining-room.&#160; Then
it&#8217;ll be all right if Wain comes and looks into
the dorm.&#160; Or, if you like, you might come down
too, as if you&#8217;d just woke up and thought you&#8217;d
heard a row.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not a bad idea.&#160;
All right.&#160; You dash along then.&#160; I&#8217;ll
get back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Wain was still in the dining-room,
drinking in the beauties of the summer night through
the open window.&#160; He gibbered slightly when Mike
reappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jackson!&#160; What do you mean
by running about outside the house in this way!&#160;
I shall punish you very heavily.&#160; I shall certainly
report the matter to the headmaster.&#160; I will not
have boys rushing about the garden in their pyjamas.&#160;
You will catch an exceedingly bad cold.&#160; You will
do me two hundred lines, Latin and English.&#160; Exceedingly
so.&#160; I will not have it.&#160; Did you not hear
me call to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir, so excited,&#8221;
said Mike, standing outside with his hands on the
sill.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no business to be
excited.&#160; I will not have it.&#160; It is exceedingly
impertinent of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir, may I come in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in!&#160; Of course, come
in.&#160; Have you no sense, boy?&#160; You are laying
the seeds of a bad cold.&#160; Come in at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike clambered through the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t find him, sir.&#160; He must
have got out of the garden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly,&#8221; said Mr.
Wain.&#160; &#8220;Undoubtedly so.&#160; It was very
wrong of you to search for him.&#160; You have been
seriously injured.&#160; Exceedingly so.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was about to say more on the subject
when Wyatt strolled into the room.&#160; Wyatt wore
the rather dazed expression of one who has been aroused
from deep sleep.&#160; He yawned before he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I heard a noise, sir,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>He called Mr. Wain &#8220;father&#8221;
in private, &#8220;sir&#8221; in public.&#160; The presence
of Mike made this a public occasion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has there been a burglary?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mike, &#8220;only he has got
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I go out into the garden,
and have a look round, sir?&#8221; asked Wyatt helpfully.</p>

<p>The question stung Mr. Wain into active eruption once
more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Under no circumstances whatever,&#8221;
he said excitedly.&#160; &#8220;Stay where you are,
James.&#160; I will not have boys running about my garden
at night.&#160; It is preposterous.&#160; Inordinately
so.&#160; Both of you go to bed immediately.&#160; I
shall not speak to you again on this subject.&#160;
I must be obeyed instantly.&#160; You hear me, Jackson?&#160;
James, you understand me?&#160; To bed at once.&#160;
And, if I find you outside your dormitory again to-night,
you will both be punished with extreme severity.&#160;
I will not have this lax and reckless behaviour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the burglar, sir?&#8221; said Wyatt.</p>

<p>&#8220;We might catch him, sir,&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>Mr. Wain&#8217;s manner changed to
a slow and stately sarcasm, in much the same way as
a motor-car changes from the top speed to its first.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was under the impression,&#8221;
he said, in the heavy way almost invariably affected
by weak masters in their dealings with the obstreperous,
&#8220;I was distinctly under the impression that I
had ordered you to retire immediately to your dormitory.&#160;
It is possible that you mistook my meaning.&#160; In
that case I shall be happy to repeat what I said.&#160;
It is also in my mind that I threatened to punish you
with the utmost severity if you did not retire at once.&#160;
In these circumstances, James&#8212;&#173;and you,
Jackson&#8212;&#173;you will doubtless see the necessity
of complying with my wishes.&#8221;</p>

<p>They made it so.</p>

CHAPTER VII<br><br>
IN WHICH MIKE IS DISCUSSED</a></h3>

<p>Trevor and Clowes, of Donaldson&#8217;s,
were sitting in their study a week after the gramophone
incident, preparatory to going on the river.&#160; At
least Trevor was in the study, getting tea ready.&#160;
Clowes was on the window-sill, one leg in the room,
the other outside, hanging over space.&#160; He loved
to sit in this attitude, watching some one else work,
and giving his views on life to whoever would listen
to them.&#160; Clowes was tall, and looked sad, which
he was not.&#160; Trevor was shorter, and very much
in earnest over all that he did.&#160; On the present
occasion he was measuring out tea with a concentration
worthy of a general planning a campaign.</p>

<p>&#8220;One for the pot,&#8221; said Clowes.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; breathed Trevor.&#160; &#8220;Come
and help, you slacker.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too busy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t doing a stroke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My lad, I&#8217;m thinking
of Life.&#160; That&#8217;s a thing you couldn&#8217;t
do.&#160; I often say to people, &#8217;Good chap,
Trevor, but can&#8217;t think of Life.&#160; Give him
a tea-pot and half a pound of butter to mess about
with,&#8217; I say, &#8217;and he&#8217;s all right.&#160;
But when it comes to deep thought, where is he?&#160;
Among the also-rans.&#8217;&#160; That&#8217;s what
I say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silly ass,&#8221; said Trevor,
slicing bread.&#160; &#8220;What particular rot were
you thinking about just then?&#160; What fun it was
sitting back and watching other fellows work, I should
think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My mind at the moment,&#8221;
said Clowes, &#8220;was tensely occupied with the
problem of brothers at school.&#160; Have you got any
brothers, Trevor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One.&#160; Couple of years younger
than me.&#160; I say, we shall want some more jam to-morrow.&#160;
Better order it to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See it done, Tigellinus, as
our old pal Nero used to remark.&#160; Where is he?&#160;
Your brother, I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marlborough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That shows your sense.&#160;
I have always had a high opinion of your sense, Trevor.&#160;
If you&#8217;d been a silly ass, you&#8217;d have let
your people send him here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#160; Shouldn&#8217;t have minded.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I withdraw what I said about
your sense.&#160; Consider it unsaid.&#160; I have a
brother myself.&#160; Aged fifteen.&#160; Not a bad chap
in his way.&#160; Like the heroes of the school stories.&#160;
&#8217;Big blue eyes literally bubbling over with
fun.&#8217;&#160; At least, I suppose it&#8217;s fun
to him.&#160; Cheek&#8217;s what I call it.&#160; My
people wanted to send him here.&#160; I lodged a protest.&#160;
I said, &#8216;One Clowes is ample for any public
school.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were right there,&#8221; said Trevor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I said, &#8216;One Clowes is
luxury, two excess.&#8217;&#160; I pointed out that
I was just on the verge of becoming rather a blood
at Wrykyn, and that I didn&#8217;t want the work of
years spoiled by a brother who would think it a rag
to tell fellows who respected and admired me&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such as who?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8212;&#8212;&#173;Anecdotes
of a chequered infancy.&#160; There are stories about
me which only my brother knows.&#160; Did I want them
spread about the school?&#160; No, laddie, I did not.&#160;
Hence, we see my brother two terms ago, packing up
his little box, and tooling off to Rugby.&#160; And
here am I at Wrykyn, with an unstained reputation,
loved by all who know me, revered by all who don&#8217;t;
courted by boys, fawned upon by masters.&#160; People&#8217;s
faces brighten when I throw them a nod.&#160; If I
frown&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come on,&#8221; said Trevor.</p>

<p>Bread and jam and cake monopolised
Clowes&#8217;s attention for the next quarter of an
hour.&#160; At the end of that period, however, he returned
to his subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;After the serious business
of the meal was concluded, and a simple hymn had been
sung by those present,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Mr. Clowes
resumed his very interesting remarks.&#160; We were
on the subject of brothers at school.&#160; Now, take
the melancholy case of Jackson Brothers.&#160; My heart
bleeds for Bob.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jackson&#8217;s all right.&#160;
What&#8217;s wrong with him?&#160; Besides, naturally,
young Jackson came to Wrykyn when all his brothers
had been here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a rotten argument.&#160;
It&#8217;s just the one used by chaps&#8217; people,
too.&#160; They think how nice it will be for all the
sons to have been at the same school.&#160; It may
be all right after they&#8217;re left, but while they&#8217;re
there, it&#8217;s the limit.&#160; You say Jackson&#8217;s
all right.&#160; At present, perhaps, he is.&#160; But
the term&#8217;s hardly started yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, what&#8217;s at
the bottom of this sending young brothers to the same
school as elder brothers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Elder brother can keep an eye on him, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it.&#160;
For once in your life you&#8217;ve touched the spot.&#160;
In other words, Bob Jackson is practically responsible
for the kid.&#160; That&#8217;s where the whole rotten
trouble starts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what happens?&#160; He
either lets the kid rip, in which case he may find
himself any morning in the pleasant position of having
to explain to his people exactly why it is that little
Willie has just received the boot, and why he didn&#8217;t
look after him better:&#160; or he spends all his spare
time shadowing him to see that he doesn&#8217;t get
into trouble.&#160; He feels that his reputation hangs
on the kid&#8217;s conduct, so he broods over him
like a policeman, which is pretty rotten for him and
maddens the kid, who looks on him as no sportsman.&#160;
Bob seems to be trying the first way, which is what
I should do myself.&#160; It&#8217;s all right, so far,
but, as I said, the term&#8217;s only just started.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Young Jackson seems all right.&#160;
What&#8217;s wrong with him?&#160; He doesn&#8217;t
stick on side any way, which he might easily do, considering
his cricket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing wrong
with him in that way.&#160; I&#8217;ve talked to him
several times at the nets, and he&#8217;s very decent.&#160;
But his getting into trouble hasn&#8217;t anything
to do with us.&#160; It&#8217;s the masters you&#8217;ve
got to consider.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#160; Does he rag?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From what I gather from fellows
in his form he&#8217;s got a genius for ragging.&#160;
Thinks of things that don&#8217;t occur to anybody
else, and does them, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He never seems to be in extra.&#160;
One always sees him about on half-holidays.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s always the way
with that sort of chap.&#160; He keeps on wriggling
out of small rows till he thinks he can do anything
he likes without being dropped on, and then all of
a sudden he finds himself up to the eyebrows in a
record smash.&#160; I don&#8217;t say young Jackson
will land himself like that.&#160; All I say is that
he&#8217;s just the sort who does.&#160; He&#8217;s
asking for trouble.&#160; Besides, who do you see him
about with all the time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s generally with Wyatt when I meet
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#160; Well, then!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with Wyatt?&#160;
He&#8217;s one of the decentest men in the school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know.&#160; But he&#8217;s
working up for a tremendous row one of these days,
unless he leaves before it comes off.&#160; The odds
are, if Jackson&#8217;s so thick with him, that he&#8217;ll
be roped into it too.&#160; Wyatt wouldn&#8217;t land
him if he could help it, but he probably wouldn&#8217;t
realise what he was letting the kid in for.&#160; For
instance, I happen to know that Wyatt breaks out of
his dorm. every other night.&#160; I don&#8217;t know
if he takes Jackson with him.&#160; I shouldn&#8217;t
think so.&#160; But there&#8217;s nothing to prevent
Jackson following him on his own.&#160; And if you&#8217;re
caught at that game, it&#8217;s the boot every time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trevor looked disturbed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody ought to speak to Bob.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the good?&#160;
Why worry him?&#160; Bob couldn&#8217;t do anything.&#160;
You&#8217;d only make him do the policeman business,
which he hasn&#8217;t time for, and which is bound
to make rows between them.&#160; Better leave him alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#160; It
would be a beastly thing for Bob if the kid did get
into a really bad row.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you must tell anybody, tell
the Gazeka.&#160; He&#8217;s head of Wain&#8217;s, and
has got far more chance of keeping an eye on Jackson
than Bob has.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Gazeka is a fool.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All front teeth and side.&#160;
Still, he&#8217;s on the spot.&#160; But what&#8217;s
the good of worrying.&#160; It&#8217;s nothing to do
with us, anyhow.&#160; Let&#8217;s stagger out, shall
we?&#8221;</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>Trevor&#8217;s conscientious nature,
however, made it impossible for him to drop the matter.&#160;
It disturbed him all the time that he and Clowes were
on the river; and, walking back to the house, he resolved
to see Bob about it during preparation.</p>

<p>He found him in his study, oiling a bat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Bob,&#8221; he said, &#8220;look here.&#160;
Are you busy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#160; Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s this way.&#160; Clowes and I were
talking&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If Clowes was there he was probably talking.&#160;
Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About your brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, by Jove,&#8221; said Bob,
sitting up.&#160; &#8220;That reminds me.&#160; I forgot
to get the evening paper.&#160; Did he get his century
all right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; asked Trevor, bewildered.</p>

<p>&#8220;My brother, J. W. He&#8217;d
made sixty-three not out against Kent in this morning&#8217;s
paper.&#160; What happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t get a paper
either.&#160; I didn&#8217;t mean that brother.&#160;
I meant the one here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mike?&#160; What&#8217;s Mike been up to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing as yet, that I know
of; but, I say, you know, he seems a great pal of
Wyatt&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know.&#160; I spoke to him about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you did?&#160; That&#8217;s all right, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with
Wyatt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit.&#160; Only he is
rather mucking about this term, I hear.&#160; It&#8217;s
his last, so I suppose he wants to have a rag.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t blame him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor do I. Rather rot, though,
if he lugged your brother into a row by accident.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should get blamed.&#160; I think I&#8217;ll
speak to him again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope he isn&#8217;t idiot
enough to go out at night with Wyatt.&#160; If Wyatt
likes to risk it, all right.&#160; That&#8217;s his
look out.&#160; But it won&#8217;t do for Mike to go
playing the goat too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Clowes suggested putting Firby-Smith
on to him.&#160; He&#8217;d have more chance, being
in the same house, of seeing that he didn&#8217;t come
a mucker than you would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done that.&#160; Smith said he&#8217;d
speak to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right then.&#160; Is that a
new bat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Got it to-day.&#160; Smashed my other yesterday&#8212;&#173;against
the school house.&#8221;</p>

<p>Donaldson&#8217;s had played a friendly
with the school house during the last two days, and
had beaten them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I heard it go.&#160; You were rather
in form.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better than at the beginning
of the term, anyhow.&#160; I simply couldn&#8217;t
do a thing then.&#160; But my last three innings have
been 33 not out, 18, and 51.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think you&#8217;re bound to get your
first all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hope so.&#160; I see Mike&#8217;s playing for
the second against the O.W.s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#160; Pretty good for his
first term.&#160; You have a pro. to coach you in the
holidays, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#160; I didn&#8217;t go
to him much this last time.&#160; I was away a lot.&#160;
But Mike fairly lived inside the net.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s not been chucked
away.&#160; I suppose he&#8217;ll get his first next
year.&#160; There&#8217;ll be a big clearing-out of
colours at the end of this term.&#160; Nearly all the
first are leaving.&#160; Henfrey&#8217;ll be captain,
I expect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Saunders, the pro. at home,
always says that Mike&#8217;s going to be the star
cricketer of the family.&#160; Better than J. W. even,
he thinks.&#160; I asked him what he thought of me,
and he said, &#8217;You&#8217;ll be making a lot of
runs some day, Mr. Bob.&#8217;&#160; There&#8217;s a
subtle difference, isn&#8217;t there?&#160; I shall
have Mike cutting me out before I leave school if I&#8217;m
not careful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sort of infant prodigy,&#8221;
said Trevor.&#160; &#8220;Don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s
quite up to it yet, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went back to his study, and Bob,
having finished his oiling and washed his hands, started
on his Thucydides.&#160; And, in the stress of wrestling
with the speech of an apparently delirious Athenian
general, whose remarks seemed to contain nothing even
remotely resembling sense and coherence, he allowed
the question of Mike&#8217;s welfare to fade from
his mind like a dissolving view.</p>

CHAPTER VIII<br><br>
A ROW WITH THE TOWN</a></h3>

<p>The beginning of a big row, one of
those rows which turn a school upside down like a
volcanic eruption and provide old boys with something
to talk about, when they meet, for years, is not unlike
the beginning of a thunderstorm.</p>

<p>You are walking along one seemingly
fine day, when suddenly there is a hush, and there
falls on you from space one big drop.&#160; The next
moment the thing has begun, and you are standing in
a shower-bath.&#160; It is just the same with a row.&#160;
Some trivial episode occurs, and in an instant the
place is in a ferment.&#160; It was so with the great
picnic at Wrykyn.</p>

<p>The bare outlines of the beginning
of this affair are included in a letter which Mike
wrote to his father on the Sunday following the Old
Wrykynian matches.</p>

<p>This was the letter:&#160;</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;DEAR FATHER,&#8212;&#173;Thanks
awfully for your letter.&#160; I hope you are quite
well.&#160; I have been getting on all right at cricket
lately.&#160; My scores since I wrote last have
been 0 in a scratch game (the sun got in my eyes
just as I played, and I got bowled); 15 for the third
against an eleven of masters (without G. B. Jones,
the Surrey man, and Spence); 28 not out in the
Under Sixteen game; and 30 in a form match.&#160; Rather
decent.&#160; Yesterday one of the men put down for
the second against the O.W.&#8217;s second couldn&#8217;t
play because his father was very ill, so I played.&#160;
Wasn&#8217;t it luck?&#160; It&#8217;s the first time
I&#8217;ve played for the second.&#160; I didn&#8217;t
do much, because I didn&#8217;t get an innings.&#160;
They stop the cricket on O.W. matches day because
they have a lot of rotten Greek plays and things
which take up a frightful time, and half the chaps
are acting, so we stop from lunch to four.&#160; Rot
I call it.&#160; So I didn&#8217;t go in, because
they won the toss and made 215, and by the time we&#8217;d
made 140 for 6 it was close of play.&#160; They&#8217;d
stuck me in eighth wicket.&#160; Rather rot.&#160;
Still, I may get another shot.&#160; And I made rather
a decent catch at mid-on.&#160; Low down.&#160; I
had to dive for it.&#160; Bob played for the first,
but didn&#8217;t do much.&#160; He was run out after
he&#8217;d got ten.&#160; I believe he&#8217;s rather
sick about it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&#8220;Rather a rummy thing happened
after lock-up.&#160; I wasn&#8217;t in it, but a fellow
called Wyatt (awfully decent chap.&#160; He&#8217;s
Wain&#8217;s step-son, only they bar one another)
told me about it.&#160; He was in it all right.&#160;
There&#8217;s a dinner after the matches on O.W.
day, and some of the chaps were going back to their
houses after it when they got into a row with a
lot of brickies from the town, and there was rather
a row.&#160; There was a policeman mixed up in it
somehow, only I don&#8217;t quite know where he comes
in.&#160; I&#8217;ll find out and tell you next time
I write.&#160; Love to everybody.&#160; Tell Marjory
I&#8217;ll write to her in a day or two.</blockquote>

<p align="center">&#8220;Your loving son,</p>

<p align="center">&#8220;MIKE.</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;P.S.&#8212;&#173;I say, I
suppose you couldn&#8217;t send me five bob, could
you?&#160; I&#8217;m rather broke.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&#8220;P.P.S.&#8212;&#173;Half-a-crown
would do, only I&#8217;d rather it was five bob.&#8221;</blockquote>

<p>And, on the back of the envelope,
these words:&#160; &#8220;Or a bob would be better
than nothing.&#8221;</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>The outline of the case was as Mike
had stated.&#160; But there were certain details of
some importance which had not come to his notice when
he sent the letter.&#160; On the Monday they were public
property.</p>

<p>The thing had happened after this
fashion.&#160; At the conclusion of the day&#8217;s
cricket, all those who had been playing in the four
elevens which the school put into the field against
the old boys, together with the school choir, were
entertained by the headmaster to supper in the Great
Hall.&#160; The banquet, lengthened by speeches, songs,
and recitations which the reciters imagined to be
songs, lasted, as a rule, till about ten o&#8217;clock,
when the revellers were supposed to go back to their
houses by the nearest route, and turn in.&#160; This
was the official programme.&#160; The school usually
performed it with certain modifications and improvements.</p>

<p>About midway between Wrykyn, the school,
and Wrykyn, the town, there stands on an island in
the centre of the road a solitary lamp-post.&#160; It
was the custom, and had been the custom for generations
back, for the diners to trudge off to this lamp-post,
dance round it for some minutes singing the school
song or whatever happened to be the popular song of
the moment, and then race back to their houses.&#160;
Antiquity had given the custom a sort of sanctity,
and the authorities, if they knew&#8212;&#173;which
they must have done&#8212;&#173;never interfered.</p>

<p>But there were others.</p>

<p>Wrykyn, the town, was peculiarly rich
in &#8220;gangs of youths.&#8221;&#160; Like the vast
majority of the inhabitants of the place, they seemed
to have no work of any kind whatsoever to occupy their
time, which they used, accordingly, to spend prowling
about and indulging in a mild, brainless, rural type
of hooliganism.&#160; They seldom proceeded to practical
rowdyism and never except with the school.&#160; As
a rule, they amused themselves by shouting rude chaff.&#160;
The school regarded them with a lofty contempt, much
as an Oxford man regards the townee.&#160; The school
was always anxious for a row, but it was the unwritten
law that only in special circumstances should they
proceed to active measures.&#160; A curious dislike
for school-and-town rows and most misplaced severity
in dealing with the offenders when they took place,
were among the few flaws in the otherwise admirable
character of the headmaster of Wrykyn.&#160; It was
understood that one scragged bargees at one&#8217;s
own risk, and, as a rule, it was not considered worth
it.</p>

<p>But after an excellent supper and
much singing and joviality, one&#8217;s views are
apt to alter.&#160; Risks which before supper seemed
great, show a tendency to dwindle.</p>

<p>When, therefore, the twenty or so
Wrykynians who were dancing round the lamp-post were
aware, in the midst of their festivities, that they
were being observed and criticised by an equal number
of townees, and that the criticisms were, as usual,
essentially candid and personal, they found themselves
forgetting the headmaster&#8217;s prejudices and feeling
only that these outsiders must be put to the sword
as speedily as possible, for the honour of the school.</p>

<p>Possibly, if the town brigade had
stuck to a purely verbal form of attack, all might
yet have been peace.&#160; Words can be overlooked.</p>

<p>But tomatoes cannot.</p>

<p>No man of spirit can bear to be pelted
with over-ripe tomatoes for any length of time without
feeling that if the thing goes on much longer he will
be reluctantly compelled to take steps.</p>

<p>In the present crisis, the first tomato
was enough to set matters moving.</p>

<p>As the two armies stood facing each
other in silence under the dim and mysterious rays
of the lamp, it suddenly whizzed out from the enemy&#8217;s
ranks, and hit Wyatt on the right ear.</p>

<p>There was a moment of suspense.&#160;
Wyatt took out his handkerchief and wiped his face,
over which the succulent vegetable had spread itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how you
fellows are going to pass the evening,&#8221; he said
quietly.&#160; &#8220;My idea of a good after-dinner
game is to try and find the chap who threw that.&#160;
Anybody coming?&#8221;</p>

<p>For the first five minutes it was
as even a fight as one could have wished to see.&#160;
It raged up and down the road without a pause, now
in a solid mass, now splitting up into little groups.&#160;
The science was on the side of the school.&#160; Most
Wrykynians knew how to box to a certain extent.&#160;
But, at any rate at first, it was no time for science.&#160;
To be scientific one must have an opponent who observes
at least the more important rules of the ring.&#160;
It is impossible to do the latest ducks and hooks
taught you by the instructor if your antagonist butts
you in the chest, and then kicks your shins, while
some dear friend of his, of whose presence you had
no idea, hits you at the same time on the back of
the head.&#160; The greatest expert would lose his science
in such circumstances.</p>

<p>Probably what gave the school the
victory in the end was the righteousness of their
cause.&#160; They were smarting under a sense of injury,
and there is nothing that adds a force to one&#8217;s
blows and a recklessness to one&#8217;s style of delivering
them more than a sense of injury.</p>

<p>Wyatt, one side of his face still
showing traces of the tomato, led the school with
a vigour that could not be resisted.&#160; He very seldom
lost his temper, but he did draw the line at bad tomatoes.</p>

<p>Presently the school noticed that
the enemy were vanishing little by little into the
darkness which concealed the town.&#160; Barely a dozen
remained.&#160; And their lonely condition seemed to
be borne in upon these by a simultaneous brain-wave,
for they suddenly gave the fight up, and stampeded
as one man.</p>

<p>The leaders were beyond recall, but
two remained, tackled low by Wyatt and Clowes after
the fashion of the football-field.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>The school gathered round its prisoners,
panting.&#160; The scene of the conflict had shifted
little by little to a spot some fifty yards from where
it had started.&#160; By the side of the road at this
point was a green, depressed looking pond.&#160; Gloomy
in the daytime, it looked unspeakable at night.&#160;
It struck Wyatt, whose finer feelings had been entirely
blotted out by tomato, as an ideal place in which to
bestow the captives.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s chuck &#8217;em in there,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>The idea was welcomed gladly by all,
except the prisoners.&#160; A move was made towards
the pond, and the procession had halted on the brink,
when a new voice made itself heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now then,&#8221; it said, &#8220;what&#8217;s
all this?&#8221;</p>

<p>A stout figure in policeman&#8217;s
uniform was standing surveying them with the aid of
a small bull&#8217;s-eye lantern.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Wyatt.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, is it?&#160; What&#8217;s on?&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the prisoners spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make &#8217;em leave hold of
us, Mr. Butt.&#160; They&#8217;re a-going to chuck us
in the pond.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho!&#8221; said the policeman,
with a change in his voice.&#160; &#8220;Ho, are they?&#160;
Come now, young gentleman, a lark&#8217;s a lark, but
you ought to know where to stop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s anything but a lark,&#8221;
said Wyatt in the creamy voice he used when feeling
particularly savage.&#160; &#8220;We&#8217;re the Strong
Right Arm of Justice.&#160; That&#8217;s what we are.&#160;
This isn&#8217;t a lark, it&#8217;s an execution.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want none of
your lip, whoever you are,&#8221; said Mr. Butt, understanding
but dimly, and suspecting impudence by instinct.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is quite a private matter,&#8221;
said Wyatt.&#160; &#8220;You run along on your beat.&#160;
You can&#8217;t do anything here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shove &#8217;em in, you chaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; From Mr. Butt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oo-er!&#8221; From prisoner number one.</p>

<p>There was a sounding splash as willing
hands urged the first of the captives into the depths.&#160;
He ploughed his way to the bank, scrambled out, and
vanished.</p>

<p>Wyatt turned to the other prisoner.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have the worst
of it, going in second.&#160; He&#8217;ll have churned
up the mud a bit.&#160; Don&#8217;t swallow more than
you can help, or you&#8217;ll go getting typhoid.&#160;
I expect there are leeches and things there, but if
you nip out quick they may not get on to you.&#160;
Carry on, you chaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was here that the regrettable incident
occurred.&#160; Just as the second prisoner was being
launched, Constable Butt, determined to assert himself
even at the eleventh hour, sprang forward, and seized
the captive by the arm.&#160; A drowning man will clutch
at a straw.&#160; A man about to be hurled into an
excessively dirty pond will clutch at a stout policeman.&#160;
The prisoner did.</p>

<p>Constable Butt represented his one
link with dry land.&#160; As he came within reach he
attached himself to his tunic with the vigour and
concentration of a limpet.</p>

<p>At the same moment the executioners
gave their man the final heave.&#160; The policeman
realised his peril too late.&#160; A medley of noises
made the peaceful night hideous.&#160; A howl from
the townee, a yell from the policeman, a cheer from
the launching party, a frightened squawk from some
birds in a neighbouring tree, and a splash compared
with which the first had been as nothing, and all
was over.</p>

<p>The dark waters were lashed into a
maelstrom; and then two streaming figures squelched
up the further bank.</p>

<center><a name="illus2">
<img src="images/jmike2.jpg" alt="THE DARK WATERS WERE LASHED INTO A MAELSTROM">
</a></center>

<p>The school stood in silent consternation.&#160;
It was no occasion for light apologies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; said Wyatt,
as he watched the Law shaking the water from itself
on the other side of the pond, &#8220;I&#8217;m not
half sure that we hadn&#8217;t better be moving!&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch9">
CHAPTER IX<br><br>
BEFORE THE STORM</a></h3>

<p>Your real, devastating row has many
points of resemblance with a prairie fire.&#160; A
man on a prairie lights his pipe, and throws away the
match.&#160; The flame catches a bunch of dry grass,
and, before any one can realise what is happening,
sheets of fire are racing over the country; and the
interested neighbours are following their example.
(I have already compared a row with a thunderstorm;
but both comparisons may stand.&#160; In dealing with
so vast a matter as a row there must be no stint.)</p>

<p>The tomato which hit Wyatt in the
face was the thrown-away match.&#160; But for the unerring
aim of the town marksman great events would never
have happened.&#160; A tomato is a trivial thing (though
it is possible that the man whom it hits may not think
so), but in the present case, it was the direct cause
of epoch-making trouble.</p>

<p>The tomato hit Wyatt.&#160; Wyatt,
with others, went to look for the thrower.&#160; The
remnants of the thrower&#8217;s friends were placed
in the pond, and &#8220;with them,&#8221; as they
say in the courts of law, Police Constable Alfred
Butt.</p>

<p>Following the chain of events, we
find Mr. Butt, having prudently changed his clothes,
calling upon the headmaster.</p>

<p>The headmaster was grave and sympathetic;
Mr. Butt fierce and revengeful.</p>

<p>The imagination of the force is proverbial.&#160;
Nurtured on motor-cars and fed with stop-watches,
it has become world-famous.&#160; Mr. Butt gave free
rein to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Threw me in, they did, sir.&#160; Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Threw you in!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. <i>Plop</i>!&#8221; said Mr. Butt,
with a certain sad relish.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, really!&#8221; said
the headmaster.&#160; &#8220;Indeed!&#160; This is&#8212;&#173;dear
me!&#160; I shall certainly&#8212;&#173;They threw you
in!&#8212;&#173;Yes, I shall&#8212;&#173;certainly&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>Encouraged by this appreciative reception
of his story, Mr. Butt started it again, right from
the beginning.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was on my beat, sir, and
I thought I heard a disturbance.&#160; I says to myself,
&#8216;&#8217;Allo,&#8217; I says, &#8217;a frakkus.&#160;
Lots of them all gathered together, and fighting.&#8217;&#160;
I says, beginning to suspect something, &#8216;Wot&#8217;s
this all about, I wonder?&#8217; I says.&#160; &#8217;Blow
me if I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a frakkus.&#8217;&#160;
And,&#8221; concluded Mr. Butt, with the air of one
confiding a secret, &#8220;and it <i>was</i> a frakkus!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And these boys actually threw you into the
pond?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Plop</i>, sir!&#160; Mrs.
Butt is drying my uniform at home at this very moment
as we sit talking here, sir.&#160; She says to me, &#8217;Why,
whatever <i>&#8217;ave</i> you been a-doing?&#160;
You&#8217;re all wet.&#8217;&#160; And,&#8221; he added,
again with the confidential air, &#8220;I <i>was</i>
wet, too.&#160; Wringin&#8217; wet.&#8221;</p>

<p>The headmaster&#8217;s frown deepened.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you are certain that your assailants were
boys from the school?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure as I am that I&#8217;m
sitting here, sir.&#160; They all &#8217;ad their caps
on their heads, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never heard of such
a thing.&#160; I can hardly believe that it is possible.&#160;
They actually seized you, and threw you into the water&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Splish</i>, sir!&#8221;
said the policeman, with a vividness of imagery both
surprising and gratifying.</p>

<p>The headmaster tapped restlessly on
the floor with his foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many boys were there?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Couple of &#8217;undred, sir,&#8221; said Mr.
Butt promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two hundred!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was dark, sir, and I couldn&#8217;t
see not to say properly; but if you ask me my frank
and private opinion I should say couple of &#8217;undred.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m&#8212;&#173;Well,
I will look into the matter at once.&#160; They shall
be punished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye-e-s&#8212;&#173;H&#8217;m&#8212;&#173;Yes&#8212;&#173;Most
severely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;&#173;Thank you, constable.&#160; Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The headmaster of Wrykyn was not a
motorist.&#160; Owing to this disadvantage he made
a mistake.&#160; Had he been a motorist, he would have
known that statements by the police in the matter of
figures must be divided by any number from two to
ten, according to discretion.&#160; As it was, he accepted
Constable Butt&#8217;s report almost as it stood.&#160;
He thought that he might possibly have been mistaken
as to the exact numbers of those concerned in his
immersion; but he accepted the statement in so far
as it indicated that the thing had been the work of
a considerable section of the school, and not of only
one or two individuals.&#160; And this made all the
difference to his method of dealing with the affair.&#160;
Had he known how few were the numbers of those responsible
for the cold in the head which subsequently attacked
Constable Butt, he would have asked for their names,
and an extra lesson would have settled the entire
matter.</p>

<p>As it was, however, he got the impression
that the school, as a whole, was culpable, and he
proceeded to punish the school as a whole.</p>

<p>It happened that, about a week before
the pond episode, a certain member of the Royal Family
had recovered from a dangerous illness, which at one
time had looked like being fatal.&#160; No official
holiday had been given to the schools in honour of
the recovery, but Eton and Harrow had set the example,
which was followed throughout the kingdom, and Wrykyn
had come into line with the rest.&#160; Only two days
before the O.W.&#8217;s matches the headmaster had
given out a notice in the hall that the following
Friday would be a whole holiday; and the school, always
ready to stop work, had approved of the announcement
exceedingly.</p>

<p>The step which the headmaster decided
to take by way of avenging Mr. Butt&#8217;s wrongs
was to stop this holiday.</p>

<p>He gave out a notice to that effect on the Monday.</p>

<p>The school was thunderstruck.&#160;
It could not understand it.&#160; The pond affair had,
of course, become public property; and those who had
had nothing to do with it had been much amused.&#160;
&#8220;There&#8217;ll be a frightful row about it,&#8221;
they had said, thrilled with the pleasant excitement
of those who see trouble approaching and themselves
looking on from a comfortable distance without risk
or uneasiness.&#160; They were not malicious.&#160;
They did not want to see their friends in difficulties.&#160;
But there is no denying that a row does break the
monotony of a school term.&#160; The thrilling feeling
that something is going to happen is the salt of life....</p>

<p>And here they were, right in it after
all.&#160; The blow had fallen, and crushed guilty
and innocent alike.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>The school&#8217;s attitude can be
summed up in three words.&#160; It was one vast, blank,
astounded &#8220;Here, I say!&#8221;</p>

<p>Everybody was saying it, though not
always in those words.&#160; When condensed, everybody&#8217;s
comment on the situation came to that.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>There is something rather pathetic
in the indignation of a school.&#160; It must always,
or nearly always, expend itself in words, and in private
at that.&#160; Even the consolation of getting on to
platforms and shouting at itself is denied to it.&#160;
A public school has no Hyde Park.</p>

<p>There is every probability&#8212;&#173;in
fact, it is certain&#8212;&#173;that, but for one malcontent,
the school&#8217;s indignation would have been allowed
to simmer down in the usual way, and finally become
a mere vague memory.</p>

<p>The malcontent was Wyatt.&#160; He
had been responsible for the starting of the matter,
and he proceeded now to carry it on till it blazed
up into the biggest thing of its kind ever known at
Wrykyn&#8212;&#173;the Great Picnic.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>Any one who knows the public schools,
their ironbound conservatism, and, as a whole, intense
respect for order and authority, will appreciate the
magnitude of his feat, even though he may not approve
of it.&#160; Leaders of men are rare.&#160; Leaders of
boys are almost unknown.&#160; It requires genius to
sway a school.</p>

<p>It would be an absorbing task for
a psychologist to trace the various stages by which
an impossibility was changed into a reality.&#160; Wyatt&#8217;s
coolness and matter-of-fact determination were his
chief weapons.&#160; His popularity and reputation
for lawlessness helped him.&#160; A conversation which
he had with Neville-Smith, a day-boy, is typical of
the way in which he forced his point of view on the
school.</p>

<p>Neville-Smith was thoroughly representative
of the average Wrykynian.&#160; He could play his part
in any minor &#8220;rag&#8221; which interested him,
and probably considered himself, on the whole, a daring
sort of person.&#160; But at heart he had an enormous
respect for authority.&#160; Before he came to Wyatt,
he would not have dreamed of proceeding beyond words
in his revolt.&#160; Wyatt acted on him like some drug.</p>

<p>Neville-Smith came upon Wyatt on his
way to the nets.&#160; The notice concerning the holiday
had only been given out that morning, and he was full
of it.&#160; He expressed his opinion of the headmaster
freely and in well-chosen words.&#160; He said it was
a swindle, that it was all rot, and that it was a
beastly shame.&#160; He added that something ought to
be done about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221; asked Wyatt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Neville-Smith
a little awkwardly, guiltily conscious that he had
been frothing, and scenting sarcasm, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
suppose one can actually <i>do</i> anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; said Wyatt.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you take the holiday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#160; Not turn up on Friday!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#160; I&#8217;m not going to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Neville-Smith stopped and stared.&#160; Wyatt was unmoved.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I simply sha&#8217;n&#8217;t go to school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re rotting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but, I say, ragging barred.&#160;
Are you just going to cut off, though the holiday&#8217;s
been stopped?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get sacked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so.&#160; But only
because I shall be the only one to do it.&#160; If
the whole school took Friday off, they couldn&#8217;t
do much.&#160; They couldn&#8217;t sack the whole school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, nor could they!&#160; I say!&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked on, Neville-Smith&#8217;s mind in a whirl,
Wyatt whistling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; said Neville-Smith
after a pause.&#160; &#8220;It would be a bit of a
rag.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think the chaps would do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If they understood they wouldn&#8217;t be alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I ask some of them?&#8221; said Neville-Smith.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could get quite a lot, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be a start, wouldn&#8217;t
it?&#160; I could get a couple of dozen from Wain&#8217;s.&#160;
We should be forty or fifty strong to start with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, what a score, wouldn&#8217;t it be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll speak to the chaps to-night, and
let you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Wyatt.&#160;
&#8220;Tell them that I shall be going anyhow.&#160;
I should be glad of a little company.&#8221;</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>The school turned in on the Thursday
night in a restless, excited way.&#160; There were
mysterious whisperings and gigglings.&#160; Groups kept
forming in corners apart, to disperse casually and
innocently on the approach of some person in authority.</p>

<p>An air of expectancy permeated each of the houses.</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch10">
CHAPTER X<br><br>
THE GREAT PICNIC</a></h3>

<p>Morning school at Wrykyn started at
nine o&#8217;clock.&#160; At that hour there was a
call-over in each of the form-rooms.&#160; After call-over
the forms proceeded to the Great Hall for prayers.</p>

<p>A strangely desolate feeling was in
the air at nine o&#8217;clock on the Friday morning.&#160;
Sit in the grounds of a public school any afternoon
in the summer holidays, and you will get exactly the
same sensation of being alone in the world as came
to the dozen or so day-boys who bicycled through the
gates that morning.&#160; Wrykyn was a boarding-school
for the most part, but it had its leaven of day-boys.&#160;
The majority of these lived in the town, and walked
to school.&#160; A few, however, whose homes were farther
away, came on bicycles.&#160; One plutocrat did the
journey in a motor-car, rather to the scandal of the
authorities, who, though unable to interfere, looked
askance when compelled by the warning toot of the
horn to skip from road to pavement.&#160; A form-master
has the strongest objection to being made to skip like
a young ram by a boy to whom he has only the day before
given a hundred lines for shuffling his feet in form.</p>

<p>It seemed curious to these cyclists
that there should be nobody about.&#160; Punctuality
is the politeness of princes, but it was not a leading
characteristic of the school; and at three minutes
to nine, as a general rule, you might see the gravel
in front of the buildings freely dotted with sprinters,
trying to get in in time to answer their names.</p>

<p>It was curious that there should be
nobody about to-day.&#160; A wave of reform could scarcely
have swept through the houses during the night.</p>

<p>And yet&#8212;&#173;where was everybody?</p>

<p>Time only deepened the mystery.&#160;
The form-rooms, like the gravel, were empty.</p>

<p>The cyclists looked at one another
in astonishment.&#160; What could it mean?</p>

<p>It was an occasion on which sane people
wonder if their brains are not playing them some unaccountable
trick.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; said Willoughby,
of the Lower Fifth, to Brown, the only other occupant
of the form-room, &#8220;the old man <i>did</i> stop
the holiday to-day, didn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what I was going to ask
you,&#8221; said Brown.&#160; &#8220;It&#8217;s jolly
rum.&#160; I distinctly remember him giving it out
in hall that it was going to be stopped because of
the O.W.&#8217;s day row.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I. I can&#8217;t make it out.&#160; Where
<i>is</i> everybody?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t <i>all</i> be late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody would have turned up by now.&#160;
Why, it&#8217;s just striking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he sent another notice
round the houses late last night, saying it was on
again all right.&#160; I say, what a swindle if he did.&#160;
Some one might have let us know.&#160; I should have
got up an hour later.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So should I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, here <i>is</i> somebody.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the master of the Lower Fifth,
Mr. Spence.&#160; He walked briskly into the room,
as was his habit.&#160; Seeing the obvious void, he
stopped in his stride, and looked puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Willoughby.&#160; Brown.&#160; Are you the only
two here?&#160; Where is everybody?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir, we don&#8217;t know.&#160; We were
just wondering.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen nobody?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were just wondering, sir,
if the holiday had been put on again, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard nothing about
it.&#160; I should have received some sort of intimation
if it had been.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say that you have seen <i>nobody</i>,
Brown?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only about a dozen fellows,
sir.&#160; The usual lot who come on bikes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None of the boarders?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#160; Not a single one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is extraordinary.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Spence pondered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you
two fellows had better go along up to Hall.&#160; I
shall go to the Common Room and make inquiries.&#160;
Perhaps, as you say, there is a holiday to-day, and
the notice was not brought to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Spence told himself, as he walked
to the Common Room, that this might be a possible
solution of the difficulty.&#160; He was not a house-master,
and lived by himself in rooms in the town.&#160; It
was just conceivable that they might have forgotten
to tell him of the change in the arrangements.</p>

<p>But in the Common Room the same perplexity
reigned.&#160; Half a dozen masters were seated round
the room, and a few more were standing.&#160; And they
were all very puzzled.</p>

<p>A brisk conversation was going on.&#160;
Several voices hailed Mr. Spence as he entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, Spence.&#160; Are you alone in the world
too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any of your boys turned up, Spence?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You in the same condition as we are, Spence?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Spence seated himself on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t any of your fellows turned up,
either?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I accepted the honourable
post of Lower Fourth master in this abode of sin,&#8221;
said Mr. Seymour, &#8220;it was on the distinct understanding
that there was going to <i>be</i> a Lower Fourth.&#160;
Yet I go into my form-room this morning, and what
do I find?&#160; Simply Emptiness, and Pickersgill II.
whistling &#8216;The Church Parade,&#8217; all flat.&#160;
I consider I have been hardly treated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no complaint to make
against Brown and Willoughby, as individuals,&#8221;
said Mr. Spence; &#8220;but, considered as a form,
I call them short measure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I confess that I am entirely
at a loss,&#8221; said Mr. Shields precisely.&#160;
&#8220;I have never been confronted with a situation
like this since I became a schoolmaster.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is most mysterious,&#8221;
agreed Mr. Wain, plucking at his beard.&#160; &#8220;Exceedingly
so.&#8221;</p>

<p>The younger masters, notably Mr. Spence
and Mr. Seymour, had begun to look on the thing as
a huge jest.</p>

<p>&#8220;We had better teach ourselves,&#8221;
said Mr. Seymour.&#160; &#8220;Spence, do a hundred
lines for laughing in form.&#8221;</p>

<p>The door burst open.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, here&#8217;s another
scholastic Little Bo-Peep,&#8221; said Mr. Seymour.&#160;
&#8220;Well, Appleby, have you lost your sheep, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to tell me&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;
began Mr. Appleby.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; said Mr. Seymour.&#160;
&#8220;Here we are, fifteen of us, all good men and
true, graduates of our Universities, and, as far as
I can see, if we divide up the boys who have come
to school this morning on fair share-and-share-alike
lines, it will work out at about two-thirds of a boy
each.&#160; Spence, will you take a third of Pickersgill
II.?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want none of your charity,&#8221;
said Mr. Spence loftily.&#160; &#8220;You don&#8217;t
seem to realise that I&#8217;m the best off of you
all.&#160; I&#8217;ve got two in my form.&#160; It&#8217;s
no good offering me your Pickersgills.&#160; I simply
haven&#8217;t room for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does it all mean?&#8221; exclaimed Mr.
Appleby.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you ask me,&#8221; said
Mr. Seymour, &#8220;I should say that it meant that
the school, holding the sensible view that first thoughts
are best, have ignored the head&#8217;s change of
mind, and are taking their holiday as per original
programme.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They surely cannot&#8212;&#8212;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, where are they then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you seriously mean that
the entire school has&#8212;&#173;has <i>rebelled</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Nay, sire,&#8217;&#8221; quoted Mr.
Spence, &#8220;&#8216;a revolution!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never heard of such a thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re making history,&#8221; said Mr.
Seymour.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be rather interesting,&#8221;
said Mr. Spence, &#8220;to see how the head will deal
with a situation like this.&#160; One can rely on him
to do the statesman-like thing, but I&#8217;m bound
to say I shouldn&#8217;t care to be in his place.&#160;
It seems to me these boys hold all the cards.&#160;
You can&#8217;t expel a whole school.&#160; There&#8217;s
safety in numbers.&#160; The thing is colossal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is deplorable,&#8221; said Mr. Wain, with
austerity.&#160; &#8220;Exceedingly so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I try to think so,&#8221; said
Mr. Spence, &#8220;but it&#8217;s a struggle.&#160;
There&#8217;s a Napoleonic touch about the business
that appeals to one.&#160; Disorder on a small scale
is bad, but this is immense.&#160; I&#8217;ve never
heard of anything like it at any public school.&#160;
When I was at Winchester, my last year there, there
was pretty nearly a revolution because the captain
of cricket was expelled on the eve of the Eton match.&#160;
I remember making inflammatory speeches myself on
that occasion.&#160; But we stopped on the right side
of the line.&#160; We were satisfied with growling.&#160;
But this&#8212;&#8212;!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Seymour got up.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an ill wind,&#8221;
he said.&#160; &#8220;With any luck we ought to get
the day off, and it&#8217;s ideal weather for a holiday.&#160;
The head can hardly ask us to sit indoors, teaching
nobody.&#160; If I have to stew in my form-room all
day, instructing Pickersgill II., I shall make things
exceedingly sultry for that youth.&#160; He will wish
that the Pickersgill progeny had stopped short at
his elder brother.&#160; He will not value life.&#160;
In the meantime, as it&#8217;s already ten past, hadn&#8217;t
we better be going up to Hall to see what the orders
of the day <i>are</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at Shields,&#8221; said
Mr. Spence.&#160; &#8220;He might be posing for a statue
to be called &#8216;Despair!&#8217; He reminds me of
Macduff. <i>Macbeth</i>, Act iv., somewhere near the
end.&#160; &#8217;What, all my pretty chickens, at one
fell swoop?&#8217; That&#8217;s what Shields is saying
to himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all very well to
make a joke of it, Spence,&#8221; said Mr. Shields
querulously, &#8220;but it is most disturbing.&#160;
Most.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exceedingly,&#8221; agreed Mr. Wain.</p>

<p>The bereaved company of masters walked
on up the stairs that led to the Great Hall.</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch11">
CHAPTER XI<br><br>
THE CONCLUSION OF THE PICNIC</a></h3>

<p>If the form-rooms had been lonely,
the Great Hall was doubly, trebly, so.&#160; It was
a vast room, stretching from side to side of the middle
block, and its ceiling soared up into a distant dome.&#160;
At one end was a dais and an organ, and at intervals
down the room stood long tables.&#160; The panels were
covered with the names of Wrykynians who had won scholarships
at Oxford and Cambridge, and of Old Wrykynians who
had taken first in Mods or Greats, or achieved any
other recognised success, such as a place in the Indian
Civil Service list.&#160; A silent testimony, these
panels, to the work the school had done in the world.</p>

<p>Nobody knew exactly how many the Hall
could hold, when packed to its fullest capacity.&#160;
The six hundred odd boys at the school seemed to leave
large gaps unfilled.</p>

<p>This morning there was a mere handful,
and the place looked worse than empty.</p>

<p>The Sixth Form were there, and the
school prefects.&#160; The Great Picnic had not affected
their numbers.&#160; The Sixth stood by their table
in a solid group.&#160; The other tables were occupied
by ones and twos.&#160; A buzz of conversation was
going on, which did not cease when the masters filed
into the room and took their places.&#160; Every one
realised by this time that the biggest row in Wrykyn
history was well under way; and the thing had to be
discussed.</p>

<p>In the Masters&#8217; library Mr.
Wain and Mr. Shields, the spokesmen of the Common
Room, were breaking the news to the headmaster.</p>

<p>The headmaster was a man who rarely
betrayed emotion in his public capacity.&#160; He heard
Mr. Shields&#8217;s rambling remarks, punctuated by
Mr. Wain&#8217;s &#8220;Exceedinglys,&#8221; to an
end.&#160; Then he gathered up his cap and gown.</p>

<p>&#8220;You say that the whole school
is absent?&#8221; he remarked quietly.</p>

<p>Mr. Shields, in a long-winded flow
of words, replied that that was what he did say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said the headmaster.</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;M!&#8221; said the headmaster.</p>

<p>There was another silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye&#8212;&#173;e&#8212;&#173;s!&#8221; said the
headmaster.</p>

<p>He then led the way into the Hall.</p>

<p>Conversation ceased abruptly as he
entered.&#160; The school, like an audience at a theatre
when the hero has just appeared on the stage, felt
that the serious interest of the drama had begun.&#160;
There was a dead silence at every table as he strode
up the room and on to the dais.</p>

<p>There was something Titanic in his
calmness.&#160; Every eye was on his face as he passed
up the Hall, but not a sign of perturbation could the
school read.&#160; To judge from his expression, he
might have been unaware of the emptiness around him.</p>

<p>The master who looked after the music
of the school, and incidentally accompanied the hymn
with which prayers at Wrykyn opened, was waiting,
puzzled, at the foot of the dais.&#160; It seemed improbable
that things would go on as usual, and he did not know
whether he was expected to be at the organ, or not.&#160;
The headmaster&#8217;s placid face reassured him.&#160;
He went to his post.</p>

<p>The hymn began.&#160; It was a long
hymn, and one which the school liked for its swing
and noise.&#160; As a rule, when it was sung, the Hall
re-echoed.&#160; To-day, the thin sound of the voices
had quite an uncanny effect.&#160; The organ boomed
through the deserted room.</p>

<p>The school, or the remnants of it,
waited impatiently while the prefect whose turn it
was to read stammered nervously through the lesson.&#160;
They were anxious to get on to what the Head was going
to say at the end of prayers.&#160; At last it was
over.&#160; The school waited, all ears.</p>

<p>The headmaster bent down from the
dais and called to Firby-Smith, who was standing in
his place with the Sixth.</p>

<p>The Gazeka, blushing warmly, stepped forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring me a school list, Firby-Smith,&#8221;
said the headmaster.</p>

<p>The Gazeka was wearing a pair of very
squeaky boots that morning.&#160; They sounded deafening
as he walked out of the room.</p>

<p>The school waited.</p>

<p>Presently a distant squeaking was
heard, and Firby-Smith returned, bearing a large sheet
of paper.</p>

<p>The headmaster thanked him, and spread it out on the
reading-desk.</p>

<p>Then, calmly, as if it were an occurrence
of every day, he began to call the roll.</p>

<p>&#8220;Abney.&#8221;</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Adams.&#8221;</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Allenby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, sir,&#8221; from a table
at the end of the room.&#160; Allenby was a prefect,
in the Science Sixth.</p>

<p>The headmaster made a mark against his name with a
pencil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Arkwright.&#8221;</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>He began to call the names more rapidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Arlington.&#160; Arthur.&#160; Ashe.&#160; Aston.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, sir,&#8221; in a shrill treble from the
rider in motorcars.</p>

<p>The headmaster made another tick.</p>

<p>The list came to an end after what
seemed to the school an unconscionable time, and he
rolled up the paper again, and stepped to the edge
of the dais.</p>

<p>&#8220;All boys not in the Sixth Form,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;will go to their form-rooms and get
their books and writing-materials, and return to the
Hall.&#8221;</p>

<p>("Good work,&#8221; murmured Mr. Seymour
to himself.&#160; &#8220;Looks as if we should get
that holiday after all.&#8221;)</p>

<p>&#8220;The Sixth Form will go to their
form-room as usual.&#160; I should like to speak to
the masters for a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded dismissal to the school.</p>

<p>The masters collected on the da&#239;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;I find that I shall not require
your services to-day,&#8221; said the headmaster.&#160;
&#8220;If you will kindly set the boys in your forms
some work that will keep them occupied, I will look
after them here.&#160; It is a lovely day,&#8221; he
added, with a smile, &#8220;and I am sure you will
all enjoy yourselves a great deal more in the open
air.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said Mr. Seymour
to Mr. Spence, as they went downstairs, &#8220;is
what I call a genuine sportsman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My opinion neatly expressed,&#8221;
said Mr. Spence.&#160; &#8220;Come on the river.&#160;
Or shall we put up a net, and have a knock?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;River, I think.&#160; Meet you at the boat-house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right.&#160; Don&#8217;t be long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If every day were run on these
lines, school-mastering wouldn&#8217;t be such a bad
profession.&#160; I wonder if one could persuade one&#8217;s
form to run amuck as a regular thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pity one can&#8217;t.&#160;
It seems to me the ideal state of things.&#160; Ensures
the greatest happiness of the greatest number.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say!&#160; Suppose the school
has gone up the river, too, and we meet them!&#160;
What shall we do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank them,&#8221; said Mr.
Spence, &#8220;most kindly.&#160; They&#8217;ve done
us well.&#8221;</p>

<p>The school had not gone up the river.&#160;
They had marched in a solid body, with the school
band at their head playing Sousa, in the direction
of Worfield, a market town of some importance, distant
about five miles.&#160; Of what they did and what the
natives thought of it all, no very distinct records
remain.&#160; The thing is a tradition on the countryside
now, an event colossal and heroic, to be talked about
in the tap-room of the village inn during the long
winter evenings.&#160; The papers got hold of it, but
were curiously misled as to the nature of the demonstration.&#160;
This was the fault of the reporter on the staff of
the <i>Worfield Intelligencer and Farmers&#8217; Guide</i>,
who saw in the thing a legitimate &#8220;march-out,&#8221;
and, questioning a straggler as to the reason for
the expedition and gathering foggily that the restoration
to health of the Eminent Person was at the bottom of
it, said so in his paper.&#160; And two days later,
at about the time when Retribution had got seriously
to work, the <i>Daily Mail</i> reprinted the account,
with comments and elaborations, and headed it &#8220;Loyal
Schoolboys.&#8221;&#160; The writer said that great
credit was due to the headmaster of Wrykyn for his
ingenuity in devising and organising so novel a thanksgiving
celebration.&#160; And there was the usual conversation
between &#8220;a rosy-cheeked lad of some sixteen
summers&#8221; and &#8220;our representative,&#8221;
in which the rosy-cheeked one spoke most kindly of
the head-master, who seemed to be a warm personal
friend of his.</p>

<p>The remarkable thing about the Great
Picnic was its orderliness.&#160; Considering that
five hundred and fifty boys were ranging the country
in a compact mass, there was wonderfully little damage
done to property.&#160; Wyatt&#8217;s genius did not
stop short at organising the march.&#160; In addition,
he arranged a system of officers which effectually
controlled the animal spirits of the rank and file.&#160;
The prompt and decisive way in which rioters were
dealt with during the earlier stages of the business
proved a wholesome lesson to others who would have
wished to have gone and done likewise.&#160; A spirit
of martial law reigned over the Great Picnic.&#160;
And towards the end of the day fatigue kept the rowdy-minded
quiet.</p>

<p>At Worfield the expedition lunched.&#160;
It was not a market-day, fortunately, or the confusion
in the narrow streets would have been hopeless.&#160;
On ordinary days Worfield was more or less deserted.&#160;
It is astonishing that the resources of the little
town were equal to satisfying the needs of the picnickers.&#160;
They descended on the place like an army of locusts.</p>

<p>Wyatt, as generalissimo of the expedition,
walked into the &#8220;Grasshopper and Ant,&#8221;
the leading inn of the town.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything I can do for you,
sir?&#8221; inquired the landlord politely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, please,&#8221; said Wyatt,
&#8220;I want lunch for five hundred and fifty.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was the supreme moment in mine
host&#8217;s life.&#160; It was his big subject of
conversation ever afterwards.&#160; He always told that
as his best story, and he always ended with the words,
&#8220;You could ha&#8217; knocked me down with a
feather!&#8221;</p>

<p>The first shock over, the staff of
the &#8220;Grasshopper and Ant&#8221; bustled about.&#160;
Other inns were called upon for help.&#160; Private
citizens rallied round with bread, jam, and apples.&#160;
And the army lunched sumptuously.</p>

<p>In the early afternoon they rested,
and as evening began to fall, the march home was started.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>At the school, net practice was just
coming to an end when, faintly, as the garrison of
Lucknow heard the first skirl of the pipes of the
relieving force, those on the grounds heard the strains
of the school band and a murmur of many voices.&#160;
Presently the sounds grew more distinct, and up the
Wrykyn road came marching the vanguard of the column,
singing the school song.&#160; They looked weary but
cheerful.</p>

<p>As the army drew near to the school,
it melted away little by little, each house claiming
its representatives.&#160; At the school gates only
a handful were left.</p>

<p>Bob Jackson, walking back to Donaldson&#8217;s,
met Wyatt at the gate, and gazed at him, speechless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo,&#8221; said Wyatt, &#8220;been
to the nets?&#160; I wonder if there&#8217;s time for
a ginger-beer before the shop shuts.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch12">
CHAPTER XII<br><br>
MIKE GETS HIS CHANCE</a></h3>

<p>The headmaster was quite bland and
business-like about it all.&#160; There were no impassioned
addresses from the dais.&#160; He did not tell the
school that it ought to be ashamed of itself.&#160;
Nor did he say that he should never have thought it
of them.&#160; Prayers on the Saturday morning were
marked by no unusual features.&#160; There was, indeed,
a stir of excitement when he came to the edge of the
dais, and cleared his throat as a preliminary to making
an announcement.&#160; Now for it, thought the school.</p>

<p>This was the announcement.</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been an outbreak
of chicken-pox in the town.&#160; All streets except
the High Street will in consequence be out of bounds
till further notice.&#8221;</p>

<p>He then gave the nod of dismissal.</p>

<p>The school streamed downstairs, marvelling.</p>

<p>The less astute of the picnickers,
unmindful of the homely proverb about hallooing before
leaving the wood, were openly exulting.&#160; It seemed
plain to them that the headmaster, baffled by the magnitude
of the thing, had resolved to pursue the safe course
of ignoring it altogether.&#160; To lie low is always
a shrewd piece of tactics, and there seemed no reason
why the Head should not have decided on it in the
present instance.</p>

<p>Neville-Smith was among these premature rejoicers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; he chuckled,
overtaking Wyatt in the cloisters, &#8220;this is all
right, isn&#8217;t it!&#160; He&#8217;s funked it.&#160;
I thought he would.&#160; Finds the job too big to
tackle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wyatt was damping.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear chap,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;it&#8217;s not over yet by a long chalk.&#160;
It hasn&#8217;t started yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#160; Why didn&#8217;t he
say anything about it in Hall, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should he?&#160; Have you ever had tick
at a shop?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I have.&#160; What do you mean?&#160;
Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they didn&#8217;t send
in the bill right away.&#160; But it came all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think he&#8217;s going to do something,
then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather.&#160; You wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wyatt was right.</p>

<p>Between ten and eleven on Wednesdays
and Saturdays old Bates, the school sergeant, used
to copy out the names of those who were in extra lesson,
and post them outside the school shop.&#160; The school
inspected the list during the quarter to eleven interval.</p>

<p>To-day, rushing to the shop for its
midday bun, the school was aware of a vast sheet of
paper where usually there was but a small one.&#160;
They surged round it.&#160; Buns were forgotten.&#160;
What was it?</p>

<p>Then the meaning of the notice flashed
upon them.&#160; The headmaster had acted.&#160; This
bloated document was the extra lesson list, swollen
with names as a stream swells with rain.&#160; It was
a comprehensive document.&#160; It left out little.</p>

<p>&#8220;The following boys will go
in to extra lesson this afternoon and next Wednesday,&#8221;
it began.&#160; And &#8220;the following boys&#8221;
numbered four hundred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bates must have got writer&#8217;s
cramp,&#8221; said Clowes, as he read the huge scroll.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>Wyatt met Mike after school, as they
went back to the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seen the &#8216;extra&#8217;
list?&#8221; he remarked.&#160; &#8220;None of the kids
are in it, I notice.&#160; Only the bigger fellows.&#160;
Rather a good thing.&#160; I&#8217;m glad you got off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Mike, who
was walking a little stiffly.&#160; &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know what you call getting off.&#160; It seems to me
you&#8217;re the chaps who got off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We got tanned,&#8221; said Mike ruefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#160; Everybody below the Upper Fourth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wyatt roared with laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Gad,&#8221; he said, &#8220;he
is an old sportsman.&#160; I never saw such a man.&#160;
He lowers all records.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad you think it funny.&#160;
You wouldn&#8217;t have if you&#8217;d been me.&#160;
I was one of the first to get it.&#160; He was quite
fresh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sting?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Should think it did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, buck up.&#160; Don&#8217;t break down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not breaking down,&#8221; said Mike
indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, I thought you weren&#8217;t.&#160;
Anyhow, you&#8217;re better off than I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An extra&#8217;s nothing much,&#8221; said
Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is when it happens to come on the same day
as the M.C.C. match.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, by Jove!&#160; I forgot.&#160;
That&#8217;s next Wednesday, isn&#8217;t it?&#160; You
won&#8217;t be able to play!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, what rot!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is, rather.&#160; Still,
nobody can say I didn&#8217;t ask for it.&#160; If one
goes out of one&#8217;s way to beg and beseech the
Old Man to put one in extra, it would be a little
rough on him to curse him when he does it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be awfully sick, if it were me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it isn&#8217;t you, so
you&#8217;re all right.&#160; You&#8217;ll probably
get my place in the team.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike smiled dutifully at what he supposed to be a
humorous sally.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or, rather, one of the places,&#8221;
continued Wyatt, who seemed to be sufficiently in
earnest.&#160; &#8220;They&#8217;ll put a bowler in
instead of me.&#160; Probably Druce.&#160; But there&#8217;ll
be several vacancies.&#160; Let&#8217;s see.&#160; Me.&#160;
Adams.&#160; Ashe.&#160; Any more?&#160; No, that&#8217;s
the lot.&#160; I should think they&#8217;d give you
a chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t rot,&#8221;
said Mike uncomfortably.&#160; He had his day-dreams,
like everybody else, and they always took the form
of playing for the first eleven (and, incidentally,
making a century in record time).&#160; To have to
listen while the subject was talked about lightly made
him hot and prickly all over.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not rotting,&#8221;
said Wyatt seriously, &#8220;I&#8217;ll suggest it
to Burgess to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s
any chance of it, really, do you?&#8221; said Mike
awkwardly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why not?&#160;
Buck up in the scratch game this afternoon.&#160; Fielding
especially.&#160; Burgess is simply mad on fielding.&#160;
I don&#8217;t blame him either, especially as he&#8217;s
a bowler himself.&#160; He&#8217;d shove a man into
the team like a shot, whatever his batting was like,
if his fielding was something extra special.&#160;
So you field like a demon this afternoon, and I&#8217;ll
carry on the good work in the evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; said Mike, overcome,
&#8220;it&#8217;s awfully decent of you, Wyatt.&#8221;</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>Billy Burgess, captain of Wrykyn cricket,
was a genial giant, who seldom allowed himself to
be ruffled.&#160; The present was one of the rare occasions
on which he permitted himself that luxury.&#160; Wyatt
found him in his study, shortly before lock-up, full
of strange oaths, like the soldier in Shakespeare.</p>

<p>&#8220;You rotter!&#160; You rotter!&#160;
You <i>worm</i>!&#8221; he observed crisply, as Wyatt
appeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear old Billy!&#8221; said
Wyatt.&#160; &#8220;Come on, give me a kiss, and let&#8217;s
be friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8212;&#8212;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;William!&#160; William!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it wasn&#8217;t illegal,
I&#8217;d like to tie you and Ashe and that blackguard
Adams up in a big sack, and drop you into the river.&#160;
And I&#8217;d jump on the sack first.&#160; What do
you mean by letting the team down like this?&#160;
I know you were at the bottom of it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>He struggled into his shirt&#8212;&#173;he
was changing after a bath&#8212;&#173;and his face
popped wrathfully out at the other end.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m awfully sorry, Bill,&#8221;
said Wyatt.&#160; &#8220;The fact is, in the excitement
of the moment the M.C.C. match went clean out of my
mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t got a mind,&#8221;
grumbled Burgess.&#160; &#8220;You&#8217;ve got a cheap
brown paper substitute.&#160; That&#8217;s your trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wyatt turned the conversation tactfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many wickets did you get to-day?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eight.&#160; For a hundred and
three.&#160; I was on the spot.&#160; Young Jackson
caught a hot one off me at third man.&#160; That kid&#8217;s
good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you play him
against the M.C.C. on Wednesday?&#8221; said Wyatt,
jumping at his opportunity.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#160; Are you sitting on my left shoe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#160; There it is in the corner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right ho!...&#160; What were you saying?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not play young Jackson for the first?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too small.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rot.&#160; What does size matter?&#160;
Cricket isn&#8217;t footer.&#160; Besides, he isn&#8217;t
small.&#160; He&#8217;s as tall as I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose he is.&#160; Dash, I&#8217;ve dropped
my stud.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wyatt waited patiently till he had
retrieved it.&#160; Then he returned to the attack.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s as good a bat as his brother, and
a better field.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Bob can&#8217;t field for
toffee.&#160; I will say that for him.&#160; Dropped
a sitter off me to-day.&#160; Why the deuce fellows
can&#8217;t hold catches when they drop slowly into
their mouths I&#8217;m hanged if I can see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You play him,&#8221; said Wyatt.&#160;
&#8220;Just give him a trial.&#160; That kid&#8217;s
a genius at cricket.&#160; He&#8217;s going to be better
than any of his brothers, even Joe.&#160; Give him
a shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Burgess hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, it&#8217;s a bit
risky,&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;With you three lunatics
out of the team we can&#8217;t afford to try many
experiments.&#160; Better stick to the men at the top
of the second.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wyatt got up, and kicked the wall
as a vent for his feelings.</p>

<p>&#8220;You rotter,&#8221; he said.&#160;
&#8220;Can&#8217;t you <i>see</i> when you&#8217;ve
got a good man?&#160; Here&#8217;s this kid waiting
for you ready made with a style like Trumper&#8217;s,
and you rave about top men in the second, chaps who
play forward at everything, and pat half-volleys back
to the bowler!&#160; Do you realise that your only
chance of being known to Posterity is as the man who
gave M. Jackson his colours at Wrykyn?&#160; In a few
years he&#8217;ll be playing for England, and you&#8217;ll
think it a favour if he nods to you in the pav. at
Lord&#8217;s.&#160; When you&#8217;re a white-haired
old man you&#8217;ll go doddering about, gassing to
your grandchildren, poor kids, how you &#8216;discovered&#8217;
M. Jackson.&#160; It&#8217;ll be the only thing they&#8217;ll
respect you for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wyatt stopped for breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Burgess,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll think it over.&#160; Frightful gift
of the gab you&#8217;ve got, Wyatt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Wyatt.&#160;
&#8220;Think it over.&#160; And don&#8217;t forget what
I said about the grandchildren.&#160; You would like
little Wyatt Burgess and the other little Burgesses
to respect you in your old age, wouldn&#8217;t you?&#160;
Very well, then.&#160; So long.&#160; The bell went
ages ago.&#160; I shall be locked out.&#8221;</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>On the Monday morning Mike passed
the notice-board just as Burgess turned away from
pinning up the list of the team to play the M.C.C.&#160;
He read it, and his heart missed a beat.&#160; For,
bottom but one, just above the W. B. Burgess, was
a name that leaped from the paper at him.&#160; His
own name.</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch13">
CHAPTER XIII<br><br>
THE M.C.C.&#160; MATCH</a></h3>

<p>If the day happens to be fine, there
is a curious, dream-like atmosphere about the opening
stages of a first eleven match.&#160; Everything seems
hushed and expectant.&#160; The rest of the school have
gone in after the interval at eleven o&#8217;clock,
and you are alone on the grounds with a cricket-bag.&#160;
The only signs of life are a few pedestrians on the
road beyond the railings and one or two blazer and
flannel-clad forms in the pavilion.&#160; The sense
of isolation is trying to the nerves, and a school
team usually bats 25 per cent. better after lunch,
when the strangeness has worn off.</p>

<p>Mike walked across from Wain&#8217;s,
where he had changed, feeling quite hollow.&#160; He
could almost have cried with pure fright.&#160; Bob
had shouted after him from a window as he passed Donaldson&#8217;s,
to wait, so that they could walk over together; but
conversation was the last thing Mike desired at that
moment.</p>

<p>He had almost reached the pavilion
when one of the M.C.C. team came down the steps, saw
him, and stopped dead.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, Saunders!&#8221; cried Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Master Mike!&#8221;</p>

<p>The professional beamed, and quite
suddenly, the lost, hopeless feeling left Mike.&#160;
He felt as cheerful as if he and Saunders had met
in the meadow at home, and were just going to begin
a little quiet net-practice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Master Mike, you don&#8217;t
mean to say you&#8217;re playing for the school already?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike nodded happily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it ripping,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Saunders slapped his leg in a sort of ecstasy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I always say it,
sir,&#8221; he chuckled.&#160; &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t I
right?&#160; I used to say to myself it &#8217;ud be
a pretty good school team that &#8217;ud leave you
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, I&#8217;m only playing
as a sub., you know.&#160; Three chaps are in extra,
and I got one of the places.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll make a hundred
to-day, Master Mike, and then they&#8217;ll have to
put you in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wish I could!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Master Joe&#8217;s come down with the Club,&#8221;
said Saunders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Joe!&#160; Has he really?&#160; How ripping!&#160;
Hullo, here he is.&#160; Hullo, Joe?&#8221;</p>

<p>The greatest of all the Jacksons was
descending the pavilion steps with the gravity befitting
an All England batsman.&#160; He stopped short, as
Saunders had done.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mike!&#160; You aren&#8217;t playing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m hanged!&#160; Young marvel,
isn&#8217;t he, Saunders?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is, sir,&#8221; said Saunders.&#160;
&#8220;Got all the strokes.&#160; I always said it,
Master Joe.&#160; Only wants the strength.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joe took Mike by the shoulder, and
walked him off in the direction of a man in a Zingari
blazer who was bowling slows to another of the M.C.C.
team.&#160; Mike recognised him with awe as one of the
three best amateur wicket-keepers in the country.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of this?&#8221;
said Joe, exhibiting Mike, who grinned bashfully.&#160;
&#8220;Aged ten last birthday, and playing for the
school.&#160; You are only ten, aren&#8217;t you, Mike?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Brother of yours?&#8221; asked the wicket-keeper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably too proud to own the relationship,
but he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there any end to
you Jacksons?&#8221; demanded the wicket-keeper in
an aggrieved tone.&#160; &#8220;I never saw such a family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is our star.&#160; You
wait till he gets at us to-day.&#160; Saunders is our
only bowler, and Mike&#8217;s been brought up on Saunders.&#160;
You&#8217;d better win the toss if you want a chance
of getting a knock and lifting your average out of
the minuses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>have</i> won the toss,&#8221;
said the other with dignity.&#160; &#8220;Do you think
I don&#8217;t know the elementary duties of a captain?&#8221;</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>The school went out to field with
mixed feelings.&#160; The wicket was hard and true,
which would have made it pleasant to be going in first.&#160;
On the other hand, they would feel decidedly better
and fitter for centuries after the game had been in
progress an hour or so.&#160; Burgess was glad as a
private individual, sorry as a captain.&#160; For himself,
the sooner he got hold of the ball and began to bowl
the better he liked it.&#160; As a captain, he realised
that a side with Joe Jackson on it, not to mention
the other first-class men, was not a side to which
he would have preferred to give away an advantage.&#160;
Mike was feeling that by no possibility could he hold
the simplest catch, and hoping that nothing would
come his way.&#160; Bob, conscious of being an uncertain
field, was feeling just the same.</p>

<p>The M.C.C. opened with Joe and a man
in an Oxford Authentic cap.&#160; The beginning of
the game was quiet.&#160; Burgess&#8217;s yorker was
nearly too much for the latter in the first over,
but he contrived to chop it away, and the pair gradually
settled down.&#160; At twenty, Joe began to open his
shoulders.&#160; Twenty became forty with disturbing
swiftness, and Burgess tried a change of bowling.</p>

<p>It seemed for one instant as if the
move had been a success, for Joe, still taking risks,
tried to late-cut a rising ball, and snicked it straight
into Bob&#8217;s hands at second slip.&#160; It was
the easiest of slip-catches, but Bob fumbled it, dropped
it, almost held it a second time, and finally let
it fall miserably to the ground.&#160; It was a moment
too painful for words.&#160; He rolled the ball back
to the bowler in silence.</p>

<p>One of those weary periods followed
when the batsman&#8217;s defence seems to the fieldsmen
absolutely impregnable.&#160; There was a sickening
inevitableness in the way in which every ball was played
with the very centre of the bat.&#160; And, as usual,
just when things seemed most hopeless, relief came.&#160;
The Authentic, getting in front of his wicket, to
pull one of the simplest long-hops ever seen on a cricket
field, missed it, and was l.b.w.&#160; And the next
ball upset the newcomer&#8217;s leg stump.</p>

<p>The school revived.&#160; Bowlers and
field were infused with a new life.&#160; Another wicket&#8212;&#173;two
stumps knocked out of the ground by Burgess&#8212;&#173;helped
the thing on.&#160; When the bell rang for the end of
morning school, five wickets were down for a hundred
and thirteen.</p>

<p>But from the end of school till lunch
things went very wrong indeed.&#160; Joe was still
in at one end, invincible; and at the other was the
great wicket-keeper.&#160; And the pair of them suddenly
began to force the pace till the bowling was in a
tangled knot.&#160; Four after four, all round the
wicket, with never a chance or a mishit to vary the
monotony.&#160; Two hundred went up, and two hundred
and fifty.&#160; Then Joe reached his century, and
was stumped next ball.&#160; Then came lunch.</p>

<p>The rest of the innings was like the
gentle rain after the thunderstorm.&#160; Runs came
with fair regularity, but wickets fell at intervals,
and when the wicket-keeper was run out at length for
a lively sixty-three, the end was very near.&#160;
Saunders, coming in last, hit two boundaries, and
was then caught by Mike.&#160; His second hit had just
lifted the M.C.C. total over the three hundred.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>Three hundred is a score that takes
some making on any ground, but on a fine day it was
not an unusual total for the Wrykyn eleven.&#160; Some
years before, against Ripton, they had run up four
hundred and sixteen; and only last season had massacred
a very weak team of Old Wrykynians with a score that
only just missed the fourth hundred.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, on the present occasion,
there was scarcely time, unless the bowling happened
to get completely collared, to make the runs.&#160;
It was a quarter to four when the innings began, and
stumps were to be drawn at a quarter to seven.&#160;
A hundred an hour is quick work.</p>

<p>Burgess, however, was optimistic,
as usual.&#160; &#8220;Better have a go for them,&#8221;
he said to Berridge and Marsh, the school first pair.</p>

<p>Following out this courageous advice,
Berridge, after hitting three boundaries in his first
two overs, was stumped half-way through the third.</p>

<p>After this, things settled down.&#160;
Morris, the first-wicket man, was a thoroughly sound
bat, a little on the slow side, but exceedingly hard
to shift.&#160; He and Marsh proceeded to play themselves
in, until it looked as if they were likely to stay
till the drawing of stumps.</p>

<p>A comfortable, rather somnolent feeling
settled upon the school.&#160; A long stand at cricket
is a soothing sight to watch.&#160; There was an absence
of hurry about the batsmen which harmonised well with
the drowsy summer afternoon.&#160; And yet runs were
coming at a fair pace.&#160; The hundred went up at
five o&#8217;clock, the hundred and fifty at half-past.&#160;
Both batsmen were completely at home, and the M.C.C.
third-change bowlers had been put on.</p>

<p>Then the great wicket-keeper took
off the pads and gloves, and the fieldsmen retired
to posts at the extreme edge of the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lobs,&#8221; said Burgess.&#160; &#8220;By Jove,
I wish I was in.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed to be the general opinion
among the members of the Wrykyn eleven on the pavilion
balcony that Morris and Marsh were in luck.&#160; The
team did not grudge them their good fortune, because
they had earned it; but they were distinctly envious.</p>

<p>Lobs are the most dangerous, insinuating
things in the world.&#160; Everybody knows in theory
the right way to treat them.&#160; Everybody knows
that the man who is content not to try to score more
than a single cannot get out to them.&#160; Yet nearly
everybody does get out to them.</p>

<p>It was the same story to-day.&#160;
The first over yielded six runs, all through gentle
taps along the ground.&#160; In the second, Marsh hit
an over-pitched one along the ground to the terrace
bank.&#160; The next ball he swept round to the leg
boundary.&#160; And that was the end of Marsh.&#160;
He saw himself scoring at the rate of twenty-four
an over.&#160; Off the last ball he was stumped by
several feet, having done himself credit by scoring
seventy.</p>

<p>The long stand was followed, as usual,
by a series of disasters.&#160; Marsh&#8217;s wicket
had fallen at a hundred and eighty.&#160; Ellerby left
at a hundred and eighty-six.&#160; By the time the
scoring-board registered two hundred, five wickets
were down, three of them victims to the lobs.&#160;
Morris was still in at one end.&#160; He had refused
to be tempted.&#160; He was jogging on steadily to
his century.</p>

<p>Bob Jackson went in next, with instructions
to keep his eye on the lob-man.</p>

<p>For a time things went well.&#160;
Saunders, who had gone on to bowl again after a rest,
seemed to give Morris no trouble, and Bob put him
through the slips with apparent ease.&#160; Twenty runs
were added, when the lob-bowler once more got in his
deadly work.&#160; Bob, letting alone a ball wide of
the off-stump under the impression that it was going
to break away, was disagreeably surprised to find
it break in instead, and hit the wicket.&#160; The
bowler smiled sadly, as if he hated to have to do
these things.</p>

<p>Mike&#8217;s heart jumped as he saw
the bails go.&#160; It was his turn next.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two hundred and twenty-nine,&#8221;
said Burgess, &#8220;and it&#8217;s ten past six.&#160;
No good trying for the runs now.&#160; Stick in,&#8221;
he added to Mike.&#160; &#8220;That&#8217;s all you&#8217;ve
got to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>All!...&#160; Mike felt as if he was
being strangled.&#160; His heart was racing like the
engines of a motor.&#160; He knew his teeth were chattering.&#160;
He wished he could stop them.&#160; What a time Bob
was taking to get back to the pavilion!&#160; He wanted
to rush out, and get the thing over.</p>

<p>At last he arrived, and Mike, fumbling
at a glove, tottered out into the sunshine.&#160; He
heard miles and miles away a sound of clapping, and
a thin, shrill noise as if somebody were screaming
in the distance.&#160; As a matter of fact, several
members of his form and of the junior day-room at
Wain&#8217;s nearly burst themselves at that moment.</p>

<p>At the wickets, he felt better.&#160;
Bob had fallen to the last ball of the over, and Morris,
standing ready for Saunders&#8217;s delivery, looked
so calm and certain of himself that it was impossible
to feel entirely without hope and self-confidence.&#160;
Mike knew that Morris had made ninety-eight, and he
supposed that Morris knew that he was very near his
century; yet he seemed to be absolutely undisturbed.&#160;
Mike drew courage from his attitude.</p>

<p>Morris pushed the first ball away
to leg.&#160; Mike would have liked to have run two,
but short leg had retrieved the ball as he reached
the crease.</p>

<p>The moment had come, the moment which
he had experienced only in dreams.&#160; And in the
dreams he was always full of confidence, and invariably
hit a boundary.&#160; Sometimes a drive, sometimes a
cut, but always a boundary.</p>

<p>&#8220;To leg, sir,&#8221; said the umpire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be in a funk,&#8221;
said a voice.&#160; &#8220;Play straight, and you can&#8217;t
get out.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Joe, who had taken the gloves
when the wicket-keeper went on to bowl.</p>

<p>Mike grinned, wryly but gratefully.</p>

<p>Saunders was beginning his run.&#160;
It was all so home-like that for a moment Mike felt
himself again.&#160; How often he had seen those two
little skips and the jump.&#160; It was like being
in the paddock again, with Marjory and the dogs waiting
by the railings to fetch the ball if he made a drive.</p>

<p>Saunders ran to the crease, and bowled.</p>

<p>Now, Saunders was a conscientious
man, and, doubtless, bowled the very best ball that
he possibly could.&#160; On the other hand, it was Mike&#8217;s
first appearance for the school, and Saunders, besides
being conscientious, was undoubtedly kind-hearted.&#160;
It is useless to speculate as to whether he was trying
to bowl his best that ball.&#160; If so, he failed
signally.&#160; It was a half-volley, just the right
distance away from the off-stump; the sort of ball
Mike was wont to send nearly through the net at home....</p>

<p>The next moment the dreams had come
true.&#160; The umpire was signalling to the scoring-box,
the school was shouting, extra-cover was trotting to
the boundary to fetch the ball, and Mike was blushing
and wondering whether it was bad form to grin.</p>

<p>From that ball onwards all was for
the best in this best of all possible worlds.&#160;
Saunders bowled no more half-volleys; but Mike played
everything that he did bowl.&#160; He met the lobs with
a bat like a barn-door.&#160; Even the departure of
Morris, caught in the slips off Saunders&#8217;s next
over for a chanceless hundred and five, did not disturb
him.&#160; All nervousness had left him.&#160; He felt
equal to the situation.&#160; Burgess came in, and
began to hit out as if he meant to knock off the runs.&#160;
The bowling became a shade loose.&#160; Twice he was
given full tosses to leg, which he hit to the terrace
bank.&#160; Half-past six chimed, and two hundred and
fifty went up on the telegraph board.&#160; Burgess
continued to hit.&#160; Mike&#8217;s whole soul was
concentrated on keeping up his wicket.&#160; There
was only Reeves to follow him, and Reeves was a victim
to the first straight ball.&#160; Burgess had to hit
because it was the only game he knew; but he himself
must simply stay in.</p>

<p>The hands of the clock seemed to have
stopped.&#160; Then suddenly he heard the umpire say
&#8220;Last over,&#8221; and he settled down to keep
those six balls out of his wicket.</p>

<p>The lob bowler had taken himself off,
and the Oxford Authentic had gone on, fast left-hand.</p>

<p>The first ball was short and wide
of the off-stump.&#160; Mike let it alone.&#160; Number
two:&#160; yorker.&#160; Got him!&#160; Three:&#160; straight
half-volley.&#160; Mike played it back to the bowler.&#160;
Four:&#160; beat him, and missed the wicket by an inch.&#160;
Five:&#160; another yorker.&#160; Down on it again in
the old familiar way.</p>

<p>All was well.&#160; The match was a
draw now whatever happened to him.&#160; He hit out,
almost at a venture, at the last ball, and mid-off,
jumping, just failed to reach it.&#160; It hummed over
his head, and ran like a streak along the turf and
up the bank, and a great howl of delight went up from
the school as the umpire took off the bails.</p>

<p>Mike walked away from the wickets
with Joe and the wicket-keeper.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry about your
nose, Joe,&#8221; said the wicket-keeper in tones of
grave solicitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At present,&#8221; said the
wicket-keeper, &#8220;nothing.&#160; But in a few years
I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s going to be put badly
out of joint.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch14">
CHAPTER XIV<br><br>
A SLIGHT IMBROGLIO</a></h3>

<p>Mike got his third eleven colours
after the M.C.C. match.&#160; As he had made twenty-three
not out in a crisis in a first eleven match, this
may not seem an excessive reward.&#160; But it was all
that he expected.&#160; One had to take the rungs of
the ladder singly at Wrykyn.&#160; First one was given
one&#8217;s third eleven cap.&#160; That meant, &#8220;You
are a promising man, and we have our eye on you.&#8221;&#160;
Then came the second colours.&#160; They might mean
anything from &#8220;Well, here you <i>are</i>.&#160;
You won&#8217;t get any higher, so you may as well
have the thing now,&#8221; to &#8220;This is just to
show that we still have our eye on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike was a certainty now for the second.&#160;
But it needed more than one performance to secure
the first cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you so,&#8221; said
Wyatt, naturally, to Burgess after the match.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not bad,&#8221;
said Burgess.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;ll give him another
shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Burgess, as has been pointed out,
was not a person who ever became gushing with enthusiasm.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>So Wilkins, of the School House, who
had played twice for the first eleven, dropped down
into the second, as many a good man had done before
him, and Mike got his place in the next match, against
the Gentlemen of the County.&#160; Unfortunately for
him, the visiting team, however gentlemanly, were
not brilliant cricketers, at any rate as far as bowling
was concerned.&#160; The school won the toss, went in
first, and made three hundred and sixteen for five
wickets, Morris making another placid century.&#160;
The innings was declared closed before Mike had a
chance of distinguishing himself.&#160; In an innings
which lasted for one over he made two runs, not out;
and had to console himself for the cutting short of
his performance by the fact that his average for the
school was still infinity.&#160; Bob, who was one of
those lucky enough to have an unabridged innings,
did better in this match, making twenty-five.&#160;
But with Morris making a hundred and seventeen, and
Berridge, Ellerby, and Marsh all passing the half-century,
this score did not show up excessively.</p>

<p>We now come to what was practically
a turning-point in Mike&#8217;s career at Wrykyn.&#160;
There is no doubt that his meteor-like flights at cricket
had an unsettling effect on him.&#160; He was enjoying
life amazingly, and, as is not uncommon with the prosperous,
he waxed fat and kicked.&#160; Fortunately for him&#8212;&#173;though
he did not look upon it in that light at the time&#8212;&#173;he
kicked the one person it was most imprudent to kick.&#160;
The person he selected was Firby-Smith.&#160; With
anybody else the thing might have blown over, to the
detriment of Mike&#8217;s character; but Firby-Smith,
having the most tender affection for his dignity, made
a fuss.</p>

<p>It happened in this way.&#160; The
immediate cause of the disturbance was a remark of
Mike&#8217;s, but the indirect cause was the unbearably
patronising manner which the head of Wain&#8217;s chose
to adopt towards him.&#160; The fact that he was playing
for the school seemed to make no difference at all.&#160;
Firby-Smith continued to address Mike merely as the
small boy.</p>

<p>The following, <i>verbatim</i>, was
the tactful speech which he addressed to him on the
evening of the M.C.C. match, having summoned him to
his study for the purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you
played a very decent innings this afternoon, and I
suppose you&#8217;re frightfully pleased with yourself,
eh?&#160; Well, mind you don&#8217;t go getting swelled
head.&#160; See?&#160; That&#8217;s all.&#160; Run along.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike departed, bursting with fury.</p>

<p>The next link in the chain was forged
a week after the Gentlemen of the County match.&#160;
House matches had begun, and Wain&#8217;s were playing
Appleby&#8217;s.&#160; Appleby&#8217;s made a hundred
and fifty odd, shaping badly for the most part against
Wyatt&#8217;s slows.&#160; Then Wain&#8217;s opened
their innings.&#160; The Gazeka, as head of the house,
was captain of the side, and he and Wyatt went in
first.&#160; Wyatt made a few mighty hits, and was then
caught at cover.&#160; Mike went in first wicket.</p>

<p>For some ten minutes all was peace.&#160;
Firby-Smith scratched away at his end, getting here
and there a single and now and then a two, and Mike
settled down at once to play what he felt was going
to be the innings of a lifetime.&#160; Appleby&#8217;s
bowling was on the feeble side, with Raikes, of the
third eleven, as the star, supported by some small
change.&#160; Mike pounded it vigorously.&#160; To one
who had been brought up on Saunders, Raikes possessed
few subtleties.&#160; He had made seventeen, and was
thoroughly set, when the Gazeka, who had the bowling,
hit one in the direction of cover-point.&#160; With
a certain type of batsman a single is a thing to take
big risks for.&#160; And the Gazeka badly wanted that
single.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; he shouted, prancing down the
pitch.</p>

<p>Mike, who had remained in his crease
with the idea that nobody even moderately sane would
attempt a run for a hit like that, moved forward in
a startled and irresolute manner.&#160; Firby-Smith
arrived, shouting &#8220;Run!&#8221; and, cover having
thrown the ball in, the wicket-keeper removed the
bails.</p>

<p>These are solemn moments.</p>

<p>The only possible way of smoothing
over an episode of this kind is for the guilty man
to grovel.</p>

<p>Firby-Smith did not grovel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy run there, you know,&#8221; he said reprovingly.</p>

<p>The world swam before Mike&#8217;s
eyes.&#160; Through the red mist he could see Firby-Smith&#8217;s
face.&#160; The sun glinted on his rather prominent
teeth.&#160; To Mike&#8217;s distorted vision it seemed
that the criminal was amused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t <i>laugh</i>, you grinning ape!&#8221;
he cried.&#160; &#8220;It isn&#8217;t funny.&#8221;</p>

<center><a name="illus3">
<img src="images/jmike3.jpg" alt="&#8220;DON&#8217;T <i>LAUGH</i>, YOU GRINNING APE&#8221;">
</a></center>

<p>He then made for the trees where the rest of the team
were sitting.</p>

<p>Now Firby-Smith not only possessed
rather prominent teeth; he was also sensitive on the
subject.&#160; Mike&#8217;s shaft sank in deeply.&#160;
The fact that emotion caused him to swipe at a straight
half-volley, miss it, and be bowled next ball made
the wound rankle.</p>

<p>He avoided Mike on his return to the
trees.&#160; And Mike, feeling now a little apprehensive,
avoided him.</p>

<p>The Gazeka brooded apart for the rest
of the afternoon, chewing the insult.&#160; At close
of play he sought Burgess.</p>

<p>Burgess, besides being captain of
the eleven, was also head of the school.&#160; He was
the man who arranged prefects&#8217; meetings.&#160;
And only a prefects&#8217; meeting, thought Firby-Smith,
could adequately avenge his lacerated dignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to speak to you, Burgess,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; said Burgess.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know young Jackson in our house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been frightfully insolent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cheeked you?&#8221; said Burgess, a man of
simple speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to call a prefects&#8217; meeting,
and lick him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Burgess looked incredulous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather a large order, a prefects&#8217;
meeting,&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;It has to be a
pretty serious sort of thing for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Frightful cheek to a school
prefect is a serious thing,&#8221; said Firby-Smith,
with the air of one uttering an epigram.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose&#8212;&#173;What did he say
to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Firby-Smith related the painful details.</p>

<p>Burgess started to laugh, but turned the laugh into
a cough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said meditatively.&#160;
&#8220;Rather thick.&#160; Still, I mean&#8212;&#173;A
prefects&#8217; meeting.&#160; Rather like crushing
a thingummy with a what-d&#8217;you-call-it.&#160;
Besides, he&#8217;s a decent kid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s frightfully conceited.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well&#8212;&#173;Well, anyhow,
look here, I&#8217;ll think it over, and let you know
to-morrow.&#160; It&#8217;s not the sort of thing to
rush through without thinking about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the matter was left temporarily at that.</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch15">
CHAPTER XV<br><br>
MIKE CREATES A VACANCY</a></h3>

<p>Burgess walked off the ground feeling
that fate was not using him well.</p>

<p>Here was he, a well-meaning youth
who wanted to be on good terms with all the world,
being jockeyed into slaughtering a kid whose batting
he admired and whom personally he liked.&#160; And
the worst of it was that he sympathised with Mike.&#160;
He knew what it felt like to be run out just when
one had got set, and he knew exactly how maddening
the Gazeka&#8217;s manner would be on such an occasion.&#160;
On the other hand, officially he was bound to support
the head of Wain&#8217;s.&#160; Prefects must stand
together or chaos will come.</p>

<p>He thought he would talk it over with
somebody.&#160; Bob occurred to him.&#160; It was only
fair that Bob should be told, as the nearest of kin.</p>

<p>And here was another grievance against
fate.&#160; Bob was a person he did not particularly
wish to see just then.&#160; For that morning he had
posted up the list of the team to play for the school
against Geddington, one of the four schools which
Wrykyn met at cricket; and Bob&#8217;s name did not
appear on that list.&#160; Several things had contributed
to that melancholy omission.&#160; In the first place,
Geddington, to judge from the weekly reports in the
<i>Sportsman</i> and <i>Field</i>, were strong this
year at batting.&#160; In the second place, the results
of the last few matches, and particularly the M.C.C.
match, had given Burgess the idea that Wrykyn was
weak at bowling.&#160; It became necessary, therefore,
to drop a batsman out of the team in favour of a bowler.&#160;
And either Mike or Bob must be the man.</p>

<p>Burgess was as rigidly conscientious
as the captain of a school eleven should be.&#160;
Bob was one of his best friends, and he would have
given much to be able to put him in the team; but
he thought the thing over, and put the temptation
sturdily behind him.&#160; At batting there was not
much to choose between the two, but in fielding there
was a great deal.&#160; Mike was good.&#160; Bob was
bad.&#160; So out Bob had gone, and Neville-Smith, a
fair fast bowler at all times and on his day dangerous,
took his place.</p>

<p>These clashings of public duty with
private inclination are the drawbacks to the despotic
position of captain of cricket at a public school.&#160;
It is awkward having to meet your best friend after
you have dropped him from the team, and it is difficult
to talk to him as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>Burgess felt very self-conscious as
he entered Bob&#8217;s study, and was rather glad
that he had a topic of conversation ready to hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Busy, Bob?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo,&#8221; said Bob, with
a cheerfulness rather over-done in his anxiety to
show Burgess, the man, that he did not hold him responsible
in any way for the distressing acts of Burgess, the
captain.&#160; &#8220;Take a pew.&#160; Don&#8217;t
these studies get beastly hot this weather.&#160; There&#8217;s
some ginger-beer in the cupboard.&#160; Have some?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thanks.&#160; I say, Bob, look here, I want
to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you can, can&#8217;t
you?&#160; This is me, sitting over here.&#160; The tall,
dark, handsome chap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s awfully awkward,
you know,&#8221; continued Burgess gloomily; &#8220;that
ass of a young brother of yours&#8212;&#173;Sorry, but
he <i>is</i> an ass, though he&#8217;s your brother&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks for the &#8216;though,&#8217;
Billy.&#160; You know how to put a thing nicely.&#160;
What&#8217;s Mike been up to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that old fool the
Gazeka.&#160; He came to me frothing with rage, and
wanted me to call a prefects&#8217; meeting and touch
young Mike up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob displayed interest and excitement
for the first time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Prefects&#8217; meeting!&#160;
What the dickens is up?&#160; What&#8217;s he been doing?&#160;
Smith must be drunk.&#160; What&#8217;s all the row
about?&#8221;</p>

<p>Burgess repeated the main facts of
the case as he had them from Firby-Smith.</p>

<p>&#8220;Personally, I sympathise with
the kid,&#8221; he added, &#8220;Still, the Gazeka
<i>is</i> a prefect&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob gnawed a pen-holder morosely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silly young idiot,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sickening thing being run out,&#8221; suggested
Burgess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know.&#160; It&#8217;s rather
hard to see what to do.&#160; I suppose if the Gazeka
insists, one&#8217;s bound to support him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Awful rot.&#160; Prefects&#8217;
lickings aren&#8217;t meant for that sort of thing.&#160;
They&#8217;re supposed to be for kids who steal buns
at the shop or muck about generally.&#160; Not for
a chap who curses a fellow who runs him out.&#160;
I tell you what, there&#8217;s just a chance Firby-Smith
won&#8217;t press the thing.&#160; He hadn&#8217;t
had time to get over it when he saw me.&#160; By now
he&#8217;ll have simmered down a bit.&#160; Look here,
you&#8217;re a pal of his, aren&#8217;t you?&#160;
Well, go and ask him to drop the business.&#160; Say
you&#8217;ll curse your brother and make him apologise,
and that I&#8217;ll kick him out of the team for the
Geddington match.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a difficult moment for Bob.&#160;
One cannot help one&#8217;s thoughts, and for an instant
the idea of going to Geddington with the team, as he
would certainly do if Mike did not play, made him waver.&#160;
But he recovered himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do that,&#8221;
he said.&#160; &#8220;I don&#8217;t see there&#8217;s
a need for anything of that sort.&#160; You must play
the best side you&#8217;ve got.&#160; I can easily talk
the old Gazeka over.&#160; He gets all right in a second
if he&#8217;s treated the right way.&#160; I&#8217;ll
go and do it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Burgess looked miserable.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Bob,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing&#8212;&#173;I mean,
you&#8217;re not a bad sort.&#8221;&#160; With which
glowing eulogy he dashed out of the room, thanking
his stars that he had won through a confoundedly awkward
business.</p>

<p>Bob went across to Wain&#8217;s to interview and soothe
Firby-Smith.</p>

<p>He found that outraged hero sitting
moodily in his study like Achilles in his tent.</p>

<p>Seeing Bob, he became all animation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;I wanted to see you.&#160; You know, that frightful
young brother of yours&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, I know,&#8221; said
Bob.&#160; &#8220;Burgess was telling me.&#160; He wants
kicking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He wants a frightful licking
from the prefects,&#8221; emended the aggrieved party.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know, you
know.&#160; Not much good lugging the prefects into
it, is there?&#160; I mean, apart from everything else,
not much of a catch for me, would it be, having to
sit there and look on.&#160; I&#8217;m a prefect, too,
you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Firby-Smith looked a little blank
at this.&#160; He had a great admiration for Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think of you,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you hadn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Bob.&#160;
&#8220;You see it now, though, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Firby-Smith returned to the original grievance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you know, it was frightful cheek.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it was.&#160; Still,
I think if I saw him and cursed him, and sent him
up to you to apologise&#8212;&#173;How would that do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right.&#160; After all, I did run him out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there&#8217;s that, of
course.&#160; Mike&#8217;s all right, really.&#160; It
isn&#8217;t as if he did that sort of thing as a habit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#160; All right then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Bob, and went to find Mike.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>The lecture on deportment which he
read that future All-England batsman in a secluded
passage near the junior day-room left the latter rather
limp and exceedingly meek.&#160; For the moment all
the jauntiness and exuberance had been drained out
of him.&#160; He was a punctured balloon.&#160; Reflection,
and the distinctly discouraging replies of those experts
in school law to whom he had put the question, &#8220;What
d&#8217;you think he&#8217;ll do?&#8221; had induced
a very chastened frame of mind.</p>

<p>He perceived that he had walked very
nearly into a hornets&#8217; nest, and the realisation
of his escape made him agree readily to all the conditions
imposed.&#160; The apology to the Gazeka was made without
reserve, and the offensively forgiving, say-no-more-about-it-but-take-care-in-future
air of the head of the house roused no spark of resentment
in him, so subdued was his fighting spirit.&#160; All
he wanted was to get the thing done with.&#160; He
was not inclined to be critical.</p>

<p>And, most of all, he felt grateful
to Bob.&#160; Firby-Smith, in the course of his address,
had not omitted to lay stress on the importance of
Bob&#8217;s intervention.&#160; But for Bob, he gave
him to understand, he, Mike, would have been prosecuted
with the utmost rigour of the law.&#160; Mike came
away with a confused picture in his mind of a horde
of furious prefects bent on his slaughter, after the
manner of a stage &#8220;excited crowd,&#8221; and
Bob waving them back.&#160; He realised that Bob had
done him a good turn.&#160; He wished he could find
some way of repaying him.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, it was an enemy
of Bob&#8217;s who suggested the way&#8212;&#173;Burton,
of Donaldson&#8217;s.&#160; Burton was a slippery young
gentleman, fourteen years of age, who had frequently
come into contact with Bob in the house, and owed
him many grudges.&#160; With Mike he had always tried
to form an alliance, though without success.</p>

<p>He happened to meet Mike going to
school next morning, and unburdened his soul to him.&#160;
It chanced that Bob and he had had another small encounter
immediately after breakfast, and Burton felt revengeful.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; said Burton,
&#8220;I&#8217;m jolly glad you&#8217;re playing for
the first against Geddington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m specially glad for one reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; inquired Mike, without
interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because your beast of a brother
has been chucked out.&#160; He&#8217;d have been playing
but for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>At any other time Mike would have
heard Bob called a beast without active protest.&#160;
He would have felt that it was no business of his to
fight his brother&#8217;s battles for him.&#160; But
on this occasion he deviated from his rule.</p>

<p>He kicked Burton.&#160; Not once or
twice, but several times, so that Burton, retiring
hurriedly, came to the conclusion that it must be
something in the Jackson blood, some taint, as it were.&#160;
They were <i>all</i> beasts.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>Mike walked on, weighing this remark,
and gradually made up his mind.&#160; It must be remembered
that he was in a confused mental condition, and that
the only thing he realised clearly was that Bob had
pulled him out of an uncommonly nasty hole.&#160; It
seemed to him that it was necessary to repay Bob.&#160;
He thought the thing over more fully during school,
and his decision remained unaltered.</p>

<p>On the evening before the Geddington
match, just before lock-up, Mike tapped at Burgess&#8217;s
study door.&#160; He tapped with his right hand, for
his left was in a sling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in!&#8221; yelled the captain.&#160; &#8220;Hullo!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m awfully sorry, Burgess,&#8221;
said Mike.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;ve crocked my wrist
a bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you do that?&#160; You were all right
at the nets?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Slipped as I was changing,&#8221; said Mike
stolidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it bad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing much.&#160; I&#8217;m afraid I shan&#8217;t
be able to play to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, that&#8217;s bad luck.&#160;
Beastly bad luck.&#160; We wanted your batting, too.&#160;
Be all right, though, in a day or two, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, rather.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hope so, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks.&#160; Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Burgess, with the comfortable
feeling that he had managed to combine duty and pleasure
after all, wrote a note to Bob at Donaldson&#8217;s,
telling him to be ready to start with the team for
Geddington by the 8.54 next morning.</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch16">
CHAPTER XVI<br><br>
AN EXPERT EXAMINATION</a></h3>

<p>Mike&#8217;s Uncle John was a wanderer
on the face of the earth.&#160; He had been an army
surgeon in the days of his youth, and, after an adventurous
career, mainly in Afghanistan, had inherited enough
money to keep him in comfort for the rest of his life.&#160;
He had thereupon left the service, and now spent most
of his time flitting from one spot of Europe to another.&#160;
He had been dashing up to Scotland on the day when
Mike first became a Wrykynian, but a few weeks in an
uncomfortable hotel in Skye and a few days in a comfortable
one in Edinburgh had left him with the impression
that he had now seen all that there was to be seen
in North Britain and might reasonably shift his camp
again.</p>

<p>Coming south, he had looked in on
Mike&#8217;s people for a brief space, and, at the
request of Mike&#8217;s mother, took the early express
to Wrykyn in order to pay a visit of inspection.</p>

<p>His telegram arrived during morning
school.&#160; Mike went down to the station to meet
him after lunch.</p>

<p>Uncle John took command of the situation at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;School playing anybody to-day, Mike?&#160; I
want to see a match.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re playing Geddington.&#160;
Only it&#8217;s away.&#160; There&#8217;s a second match
on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you&#8212;&#173;Hullo,
I didn&#8217;t see.&#160; What have you been doing to
yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Crocked my wrist a bit.&#160; It&#8217;s nothing
much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you do that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Slipped while I was changing after cricket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much, thanks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doctor seen it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#160; But it&#8217;s really nothing.&#160;
Be all right by Monday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m.&#160; Somebody ought to look at it.&#160;
I&#8217;ll have a look later on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike did not appear to relish this prospect.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t anything, Uncle John, really.&#160;
It doesn&#8217;t matter a bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind.&#160; It won&#8217;t
do any harm having somebody examine it who knows a
bit about these things.&#160; Now, what shall we do.&#160;
Go on the river?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t be able to steer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could manage about that.&#160;
Still, I think I should like to see the place first.&#160;
Your mother&#8217;s sure to ask me if you showed me
round.&#160; It&#8217;s like going over the stables
when you&#8217;re stopping at a country-house.&#160;
Got to be done, and better do it as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is never very interesting playing
the part of showman at school.&#160; Both Mike and
his uncle were inclined to scamp the business.&#160;
Mike pointed out the various landmarks without much
enthusiasm&#8212;&#173;it is only after one has left
a few years that the school buildings take to themselves
romance&#8212;&#173;and Uncle John said, &#8220;Ah yes,
I see.&#160; Very nice,&#8221; two or three times in
an absent voice; and they passed on to the cricket
field, where the second eleven were playing a neighbouring
engineering school.&#160; It was a glorious day.&#160;
The sun had never seemed to Mike so bright or the
grass so green.&#160; It was one of those days when
the ball looks like a large vermilion-coloured football
as it leaves the bowler&#8217;s hand.&#160; If ever
there was a day when it seemed to Mike that a century
would have been a certainty, it was this Saturday.&#160;
A sudden, bitter realisation of all he had given up
swept over him, but he choked the feeling down.&#160;
The thing was done, and it was no good brooding over
the might-have-beens now.&#160; Still&#8212;&#173;And
the Geddington ground was supposed to be one of the
easiest scoring grounds of all the public schools!</p>

<p>&#8220;Well hit, by George!&#8221;
remarked Uncle John, as Trevor, who had gone in first
wicket for the second eleven, swept a half-volley to
leg round to the bank where they were sitting.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Trevor,&#8221;
said Mike.&#160; &#8220;Chap in Donaldson&#8217;s.&#160;
The fellow at the other end is Wilkins.&#160; He&#8217;s
in the School House.&#160; They look as if they were
getting set.&#160; By Jove,&#8221; he said enviously,
&#8220;pretty good fun batting on a day like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Uncle John detected the envious note.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you would have been playing here
but for your wrist?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I was playing for the first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the first?&#160; For the
school!&#160; My word, Mike, I didn&#8217;t know that.&#160;
No wonder you&#8217;re feeling badly treated.&#160;
Of course, I remember your father saying you had played
once for the school, and done well; but I thought
that was only as a substitute.&#160; I didn&#8217;t
know you were a regular member of the team.&#160; What
bad luck.&#160; Will you get another chance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Depends on Bob.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has Bob got your place?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he does well to-day, they&#8217;ll probably
keep him in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there room for both of you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a lot of old colours.&#160;
There are only three vacancies, and Henfrey got one
of those a week ago.&#160; I expect they&#8217;ll give
one of the other two to a bowler, Neville-Smith, I
should think, if he does well against Geddington.&#160;
Then there&#8217;ll be only the last place left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather awkward, that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still, it&#8217;s Bob&#8217;s
last year.&#160; I&#8217;ve got plenty of time.&#160;
But I wish I could get in this year.&#8221;</p>

<p>After they had watched the match for
an hour, Uncle John&#8217;s restless nature asserted
itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose we go for a pull on the river now?&#8221;
he suggested.</p>

<p>They got up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s just call at the
shop,&#8221; said Mike.&#160; &#8220;There ought to
be a telegram from Geddington by this time.&#160; I
wonder how Bob&#8217;s got on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Apparently Bob had not had a chance
yet of distinguishing himself.&#160; The telegram read,
&#8220;Geddington 151 for four.&#160; Lunch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not bad that,&#8221; said Mike.&#160;
&#8220;But I believe they&#8217;re weak in bowling.&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked down the road towards
the school landing-stage.</p>

<p>&#8220;The worst of a school,&#8221;
said Uncle John, as he pulled up-stream with strong,
unskilful stroke, &#8220;is that one isn&#8217;t allowed
to smoke on the grounds.&#160; I badly want a pipe.&#160;
The next piece of shade that you see, sing out, and
we&#8217;ll put in there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pull your left,&#8221; said
Mike.&#160; &#8220;That willow&#8217;s what you want.&#8221;</p>

<p>Uncle John looked over his shoulder,
caught a crab, recovered himself, and steered the
boat in under the shade of the branches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put the rope over that stump.&#160;
Can you manage with one hand?&#160; Here, let me&#8212;&#173;Done
it?&#160; Good.&#160; A-ah!&#8221;</p>

<p>He blew a great cloud of smoke into
the air, and sighed contentedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you don&#8217;t smoke, Mike?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rotten trick for a boy.&#160;
When you get to my age you need it.&#160; Boys ought
to be thinking about keeping themselves fit and being
good at games.&#160; Which reminds me.&#160; Let&#8217;s
have a look at the wrist.&#8221;</p>

<p>A hunted expression came into Mike&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really nothing,&#8221;
he began, but his uncle had already removed the sling,
and was examining the arm with the neat rapidity of
one who has been brought up to such things.</p>

<p>To Mike it seemed as if everything
in the world was standing still and waiting.&#160;
He could hear nothing but his own breathing.</p>

<p>His uncle pressed the wrist gingerly
once or twice, then gave it a little twist.</p>

<p>&#8220;That hurt?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye&#8212;&#173;no,&#8221; stammered Mike.</p>

<p>Uncle John looked up sharply.&#160; Mike was crimson.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the game?&#8221; inquired Uncle
John.</p>

<p>Mike said nothing.</p>

<p>There was a twinkle in his uncle&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;May as well tell me.&#160; I
won&#8217;t give you away.&#160; Why this wounded warrior
business when you&#8217;ve no more the matter with
you than I have?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I only wanted to get out of
having to write this morning.&#160; There was an exam.
on.&#8221;</p>

<p>The idea had occurred to him just
before he spoke.&#160; It had struck him as neat and
plausible.</p>

<p>To Uncle John it did not appear in the same light.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you always write with your
left hand?&#160; And if you had gone with the first
eleven to Geddington, wouldn&#8217;t that have got
you out of your exam?&#160; Try again.&#8221;</p>

<p>When in doubt, one may as well tell the truth.&#160;
Mike told it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know.&#160; It wasn&#8217;t that, really.&#160;
Only&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, dash it all then.&#160;
Old Bob got me out of an awful row the day before
yesterday, and he seemed a bit sick at not playing
for the first, so I thought I might as well let him.&#160;
That&#8217;s how it was.&#160; Look here, swear you
won&#8217;t tell him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Uncle John was silent.&#160; Inwardly
he was deciding that the five shillings which he had
intended to bestow on Mike on his departure should
become a sovereign. (This, it may be mentioned as an
interesting biographical fact, was the only occasion
in his life on which Mike earned money at the rate
of fifteen shillings a half-minute.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Swear you won&#8217;t tell him.&#160; He&#8217;d
be most frightfully sick if he knew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t tell him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Conversation dwindled to vanishing-point.&#160;
Uncle John smoked on in weighty silence, while Mike,
staring up at the blue sky through the branches of
the willow, let his mind wander to Geddington, where
his fate was even now being sealed.&#160; How had the
school got on?&#160; What had Bob done?&#160; If he
made about twenty, would they give him his cap?&#160;
Supposing....</p>

<p>A faint snore from Uncle John broke
in on his meditations.&#160; Then there was a clatter
as a briar pipe dropped on to the floor of the boat,
and his uncle sat up, gaping.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jove, I was nearly asleep.&#160;
What&#8217;s the time?&#160; Just on six?&#160; Didn&#8217;t
know it was so late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to be getting back
soon, I think.&#160; Lock-up&#8217;s at half-past.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Up with the anchor, then.&#160;
You can tackle that rope with two hands now, eh?&#160;
We are not observed.&#160; Don&#8217;t fall overboard.&#160;
I&#8217;m going to shove her off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be another telegram,
I should think,&#8221; said Mike, as they reached
the school gates.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we go and look?&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked to the shop.</p>

<p>A second piece of grey paper had been
pinned up under the first.&#160; Mike pushed his way
through the crowd.&#160; It was a longer message this
time.</p>

<p>It ran as follows:&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;Geddington 247 (Burgess six
wickets, Neville-Smith four).&#160;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Wrykyn 270 for nine (Berridge 86,
Marsh 58, Jackson 48).&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike worked his way back through the throng, and rejoined
his uncle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said Uncle John.</p>

<p>&#8220;We won.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bob made forty-eight,&#8221; he added carelessly.</p>

<p>Uncle John felt in his pocket, and
silently slid a sovereign into Mike&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>It was the only possible reply.</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch17">
CHAPTER XVII<br><br>
ANOTHER VACANCY</a></h3>

<p>Wyatt got back late that night, arriving
at the dormitory as Mike was going to bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, I&#8217;m done,&#8221;
he said.&#160; &#8220;It was simply baking at Geddington.&#160;
And I came back in a carriage with Neville-Smith and
Ellerby, and they ragged the whole time.&#160; I wanted
to go to sleep, only they wouldn&#8217;t let me.&#160;
Old Smith was awfully bucked because he&#8217;d taken
four wickets.&#160; I should think he&#8217;d go off
his nut if he took eight ever.&#160; He was singing
comic songs when he wasn&#8217;t trying to put Ellerby
under the seat.&#160; How&#8217;s your wrist?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, better, thanks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wyatt began to undress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any colours?&#8221; asked Mike
after a pause.&#160; First eleven colours were generally
given in the pavilion after a match or on the journey
home.</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#160; Only one or two thirds.&#160;
Jenkins and Clephane, and another chap, can&#8217;t
remember who.&#160; No first, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was Bob&#8217;s innings like?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not bad.&#160; A bit lucky.&#160;
He ought to have been out before he&#8217;d scored,
and he was out when he&#8217;d made about sixteen,
only the umpire didn&#8217;t seem to know that it&#8217;s
l-b-w when you get your leg right in front of the
wicket and the ball hits it.&#160; Never saw a clearer
case in my life.&#160; I was in at the other end.&#160;
Bit rotten for the Geddington chaps.&#160; Just lost
them the match.&#160; Their umpire, too.&#160; Bit of
luck for Bob.&#160; He didn&#8217;t give the ghost
of a chance after that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have thought they&#8217;d
have given him his colours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most captains would have done,
only Burgess is so keen on fielding that he rather
keeps off it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, did he field badly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rottenly.&#160; And the man
always will choose Billy&#8217;s bowling to drop catches
off.&#160; And Billy would cut his rich uncle from Australia
if he kept on dropping them off him.&#160; Bob&#8217;s
fielding&#8217;s perfectly sinful.&#160; He was pretty
bad at the beginning of the season, but now he&#8217;s
got so nervous that he&#8217;s a dozen times worse.&#160;
He turns a delicate green when he sees a catch coming.&#160;
He let their best man off twice in one over, off Billy,
to-day; and the chap went on and made a hundred odd.&#160;
Ripping innings bar those two chances.&#160; I hear
he&#8217;s got an average of eighty in school matches
this season.&#160; Beastly man to bowl to.&#160; Knocked
me off in half a dozen overs.&#160; And, when he does
give a couple of easy chances, Bob puts them both
on the floor.&#160; Billy wouldn&#8217;t have given
him his cap after the match if he&#8217;d made a hundred.&#160;
Bob&#8217;s the sort of man who wouldn&#8217;t catch
a ball if you handed it to him on a plate, with watercress
round it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Burgess, reviewing the match that
night, as he lay awake in his cubicle, had come to
much the same conclusion.&#160; He was very fond of
Bob, but two missed catches in one over was straining
the bonds of human affection too far.&#160; There would
have been serious trouble between David and Jonathan
if either had persisted in dropping catches off the
other&#8217;s bowling.&#160; He writhed in bed as he
remembered the second of the two chances which the
wretched Bob had refused.&#160; The scene was indelibly
printed on his mind.&#160; Chap had got a late cut which
he fancied rather.&#160; With great guile he had fed
this late cut.&#160; Sent down a couple which he put
to the boundary.&#160; Then fired a third much faster
and a bit shorter.&#160; Chap had a go at it, just as
he had expected:&#160; and he felt that life was a
good thing after all when the ball just touched the
corner of the bat and flew into Bob&#8217;s hands.&#160;
And Bob dropped it!</p>

<p>The memory was too bitter.&#160; If
he dwelt on it, he felt, he would get insomnia.&#160;
So he turned to pleasanter reflections:&#160; the yorker
which had shattered the second-wicket man, and the
slow head-ball which had led to a big hitter being
caught on the boundary.&#160; Soothed by these memories,
he fell asleep.</p>

<p>Next morning he found himself in a
softened frame of mind.&#160; He thought of Bob&#8217;s
iniquities with sorrow rather than wrath.&#160; He felt
towards him much as a father feels towards a prodigal
son whom there is still a chance of reforming.&#160;
He overtook Bob on his way to chapel.</p>

<p>Directness was always one of Burgess&#8217;s
leading qualities.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Bob.&#160; About
your fielding.&#160; It&#8217;s simply awful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob was all remorse.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s those beastly slip catches.&#160;
I can&#8217;t time them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That one yesterday was right into your hands.&#160;
Both of them were.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know.&#160; I&#8217;m frightfully sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, but I mean, why <i>can&#8217;t</i>
you hold them?&#160; It&#8217;s no good being a good
bat&#8212;&#173;you&#8217;re that all right&#8212;&#173;if
you&#8217;re going to give away runs in the field.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, I believe I should
do better in the deep.&#160; I could get time to watch
them there.&#160; I wish you&#8217;d give me a shot
in the deep&#8212;&#173;for the second.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Second be blowed!&#160; I want
your batting in the first.&#160; Do you think you&#8217;d
really do better in the deep?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m almost certain I
should.&#160; I&#8217;ll practise like mad.&#160; Trevor&#8217;ll
hit me up catches.&#160; I hate the slips.&#160; I get
in the dickens of a funk directly the bowler starts
his run now.&#160; I know that if a catch does come,
I shall miss it.&#160; I&#8217;m certain the deep would
be much better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right then.&#160; Try it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The conversation turned to less pressing topics.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>In the next two matches, accordingly,
Bob figured on the boundary, where he had not much
to do except throw the ball back to the bowler, and
stop an occasional drive along the carpet.&#160; The
beauty of fielding in the deep is that no unpleasant
surprises can be sprung upon one.&#160; There is just
that moment or two for collecting one&#8217;s thoughts
which makes the whole difference.&#160; Bob, as he
stood regarding the game from afar, found his self-confidence
returning slowly, drop by drop.</p>

<p>As for Mike, he played for the second,
and hoped for the day.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>His opportunity came at last.&#160;
It will be remembered that on the morning after the
Great Picnic the headmaster made an announcement in
Hall to the effect that, owing to an outbreak of chicken-pox
in the town, all streets except the High Street would
be out of bounds.&#160; This did not affect the bulk
of the school, for most of the shops to which any
one ever thought of going were in the High Street.&#160;
But there were certain inquiring minds who liked to
ferret about in odd corners.</p>

<p>Among these was one Leather-Twigg,
of Seymour&#8217;s, better known in criminal circles
as Shoeblossom.</p>

<p>Shoeblossom was a curious mixture
of the Energetic Ragger and the Quiet Student.&#160;
On a Monday evening you would hear a hideous uproar
proceeding from Seymour&#8217;s junior day-room; and,
going down with a swagger-stick to investigate, you
would find a tangled heap of squealing humanity on
the floor, and at the bottom of the heap, squealing
louder than any two others, would be Shoeblossom, his
collar burst and blackened and his face apoplectically
crimson.&#160; On the Tuesday afternoon, strolling
in some shady corner of the grounds you would come
upon him lying on his chest, deep in some work of fiction
and resentful of interruption.&#160; On the Wednesday
morning he would be in receipt of four hundred lines
from his housemaster for breaking three windows and
a gas-globe.&#160; Essentially a man of moods, Shoeblossom.</p>

<p>It happened about the date of the
Geddington match that he took out from the school
library a copy of &#8220;The Iron Pirate,&#8221; and
for the next day or two he wandered about like a lost
spirit trying to find a sequestered spot in which
to read it.&#160; His inability to hit on such a spot
was rendered more irritating by the fact that, to judge
from the first few chapters (which he had managed
to get through during prep. one night under the eye
of a short-sighted master), the book was obviously
the last word in hot stuff.&#160; He tried the junior
day-room, but people threw cushions at him.&#160; He
tried out of doors, and a ball hit from a neighbouring
net nearly scalped him.&#160; Anything in the nature
of concentration became impossible in these circumstances.</p>

<p>Then he recollected that in a quiet
backwater off the High Street there was a little confectioner&#8217;s
shop, where tea might be had at a reasonable sum,
and also, what was more important, peace.</p>

<p>He made his way there, and in the
dingy back shop, all amongst the dust and bluebottles,
settled down to a thoughtful perusal of chapter six.</p>

<p>Upstairs, at the same moment, the
doctor was recommending that Master John George, the
son of the house, be kept warm and out of draughts
and not permitted to scratch himself, however necessary
such an action might seem to him.&#160; In brief, he
was attending J. G. for chicken-pox.</p>

<p>Shoeblossom came away, entering the
High Street furtively, lest Authority should see him
out of bounds, and returned to the school, where he
went about his lawful occasions as if there were no
such thing as chicken-pox in the world.</p>

<p>But all the while the microbe was
getting in some unostentatious but clever work.&#160;
A week later Shoeblossom began to feel queer.&#160;
He had occasional headaches, and found himself oppressed
by a queer distaste for food.&#160; The professional
advice of Dr. Oakes, the school doctor, was called
for, and Shoeblossom took up his abode in the Infirmary,
where he read <i>Punch</i>, sucked oranges, and thought
of Life.</p>

<p>Two days later Barry felt queer.&#160;
He, too, disappeared from Society.</p>

<p>Chicken-pox is no respecter of persons.&#160;
The next victim was Marsh, of the first eleven.&#160;
Marsh, who was top of the school averages.&#160; Where
were his drives now, his late cuts that were wont to
set the pavilion in a roar.&#160; Wrapped in a blanket,
and looking like the spotted marvel of a travelling
circus, he was driven across to the Infirmary in a
four-wheeler, and it became incumbent upon Burgess
to select a substitute for him.</p>

<p>And so it came about that Mike soared
once again into the ranks of the elect, and found
his name down in the team to play against the Incogniti.</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch18">
CHAPTER XVIII<br><br>
BOB HAS NEWS TO IMPART</a></h3>

<p>Wrykyn went down badly before the
Incogs.&#160; It generally happens at least once in
a school cricket season that the team collapses hopelessly,
for no apparent reason.&#160; Some schools do it in
nearly every match, but Wrykyn so far had been particularly
fortunate this year.&#160; They had only been beaten
once, and that by a mere twenty odd runs in a hard-fought
game.&#160; But on this particular day, against a not
overwhelmingly strong side, they failed miserably.&#160;
The weather may have had something to do with it,
for rain fell early in the morning, and the school,
batting first on the drying wicket, found themselves
considerably puzzled by a slow left-hander.&#160; Morris
and Berridge left with the score still short of ten,
and after that the rout began.&#160; Bob, going in
fourth wicket, made a dozen, and Mike kept his end
up, and was not out eleven; but nobody except Wyatt,
who hit out at everything and knocked up thirty before
he was stumped, did anything to distinguish himself.&#160;
The total was a hundred and seven, and the Incogniti,
batting when the wicket was easier, doubled this.</p>

<p>The general opinion of the school
after this match was that either Mike or Bob would
have to stand down from the team when it was definitely
filled up, for Neville-Smith, by showing up well with
the ball against the Incogniti when the others failed
with the bat, made it practically certain that he
would get one of the two vacancies.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I do&#8221; he said to Wyatt,
&#8220;there will be the biggest bust of modern times
at my place.&#160; My pater is away for a holiday in
Norway, and I&#8217;m alone, bar the servants.&#160;
And I can square them.&#160; Will you come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tea?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tea!&#8221; said Neville-Smith scornfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you ever have feeds
in the dorms. after lights-out in the houses?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Used to when I was a kid.&#160;
Too old now.&#160; Have to look after my digestion.&#160;
I remember, three years ago, when Wain&#8217;s won
the footer cup, we got up and fed at about two in
the morning.&#160; All sorts of luxuries.&#160; Sardines
on sugar-biscuits.&#160; I&#8217;ve got the taste in
my mouth still.&#160; Do you remember Macpherson?&#160;
Left a couple of years ago.&#160; His food ran out,
so he spread brown-boot polish on bread, and ate that.&#160;
Got through a slice, too.&#160; Wonderful chap!&#160;
But what about this thing of yours?&#160; What time&#8217;s
it going to be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleven suit you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about getting out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it as quickly
as the team did to-day.&#160; I can&#8217;t say more
than that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m an exceptional sort of chap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about the Jacksons?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a close
thing.&#160; If Bob&#8217;s fielding were to improve
suddenly, he would just do it.&#160; But young Mike&#8217;s
all over him as a bat.&#160; In a year or two that
kid&#8217;ll be a marvel.&#160; He&#8217;s bound to
get in next year, of course, so perhaps it would be
better if Bob got the place as it&#8217;s his last
season.&#160; Still, one wants the best man, of course.&#8221;</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>Mike avoided Bob as much as possible
during this anxious period; and he privately thought
it rather tactless of the latter when, meeting him
one day outside Donaldson&#8217;s, he insisted on his
coming in and having some tea.</p>

<p>Mike shuffled uncomfortably as his
brother filled the kettle and lit the Etna.&#160; It
required more tact than he had at his disposal to carry
off a situation like this.</p>

<p>Bob, being older, was more at his
ease.&#160; He got tea ready, making desultory conversation
the while, as if there were no particular reason why
either of them should feel uncomfortable in the other&#8217;s
presence.&#160; When he had finished, he poured Mike
out a cup, passed him the bread, and sat down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not seen much of each other lately, Mike, what?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike murmured unintelligibly through a mouthful of
bread-and-jam.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no good pretending
it isn&#8217;t an awkward situation,&#8221; continued
Bob, &#8220;because it is.&#160; Beastly awkward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Awful rot the pater sending us to the same
school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know.&#160;
We&#8217;ve all been at Wrykyn.&#160; Pity to spoil
the record.&#160; It&#8217;s your fault for being such
a young Infant Prodigy, and mine for not being able
to field like an ordinary human being.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You get on much better in the deep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bit better, yes.&#160; Liable
at any moment to miss a sitter, though.&#160; Not that
it matters much really whether I do now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike stared.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#160; Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I wanted
to see you about.&#160; Has Burgess said anything to
you yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#160; Why?&#160; What about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve a sort of
idea our little race is over.&#160; I fancy you&#8217;ve
won.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve not heard a word&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have.&#160; I&#8217;ll tell
you what makes me think the thing&#8217;s settled.&#160;
I was in the pav. just now, in the First room, trying
to find a batting-glove I&#8217;d mislaid.&#160; There
was a copy of the <i>Wrykynian</i> lying on the mantelpiece,
and I picked it up and started reading it.&#160; So
there wasn&#8217;t any noise to show anybody outside
that there was some one in the room.&#160; And then
I heard Burgess and Spence jawing on the steps.&#160;
They thought the place was empty, of course.&#160; I
couldn&#8217;t help hearing what they said.&#160; The
pav.&#8217;s like a sounding-board.&#160; I heard every
word.&#160; Spence said, &#8217;Well, it&#8217;s about
as difficult a problem as any captain of cricket at
Wrykyn has ever had to tackle.&#8217;&#160; I had a
sort of idea that old Billy liked to boss things all
on his own, but apparently he does consult Spence
sometimes.&#160; After all, he&#8217;s cricket-master,
and that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s there for.&#160; Well,
Billy said, &#8217;I don&#8217;t know what to do.&#160;
What do you think, sir?&#8217; Spence said, &#8217;Well,
I&#8217;ll give you my opinion, Burgess, but don&#8217;t
feel bound to act on it.&#160; I&#8217;m simply saying
what I think.&#8217;&#160; &#8216;Yes, sir,&#8217; said
old Bill, doing a big Young Disciple with Wise Master
act. &#8216;<i>I</i> think M.,&#8217; said Spence.&#160;
&#8217;Decidedly M. He&#8217;s a shade better than
R. now, and in a year or two, of course, there&#8217;ll
be no comparison.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, rot,&#8221; muttered Mike,
wiping the sweat off his forehead.&#160; This was one
of the most harrowing interviews he had ever been through.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all.&#160; Billy agreed
with him.&#160; &#8216;That&#8217;s just what I think,
sir,&#8217; he said.&#160; &#8216;It&#8217;s rough
on Bob, but still&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8217; And then
they walked down the steps.&#160; I waited a bit to
give them a good start, and then sheered off myself.&#160;
And so home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike looked at the floor, and said nothing.</p>

<p>There was nothing much to <i>be</i> said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what I wanted to see
you about was this,&#8221; resumed Bob.&#160; &#8220;I
don&#8217;t propose to kiss you or anything; but,
on the other hand, don&#8217;t let&#8217;s go to the
other extreme.&#160; I&#8217;m not saying that it isn&#8217;t
a bit of a brick just missing my cap like this, but
it would have been just as bad for you if you&#8217;d
been the one dropped.&#160; It&#8217;s the fortune of
war.&#160; I don&#8217;t want you to go about feeling
that you&#8217;ve blighted my life, and so on, and
dashing up side-streets to avoid me because you think
the sight of you will be painful.&#160; As it isn&#8217;t
me, I&#8217;m jolly glad it&#8217;s you; and I shall
cadge a seat in the pavilion from you when you&#8217;re
playing for England at the Oval.&#160; Congratulate
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the custom at Wrykyn, when
you congratulated a man on getting colours, to shake
his hand.&#160; They shook hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, awfully, Bob,&#8221;
said Mike.&#160; And after that there seemed to be
nothing much to talk about.&#160; So Mike edged out
of the room, and tore across to Wain&#8217;s.</p>

<p>He was sorry for Bob, but he would
not have been human (which he certainly was) if the
triumph of having won through at last into the first
eleven had not dwarfed commiseration.&#160; It had been
his one ambition, and now he had achieved it.</p>

<p>The annoying part of the thing was
that he had nobody to talk to about it.&#160; Until
the news was official he could not mention it to the
common herd.&#160; It wouldn&#8217;t do.&#160; The only
possible confidant was Wyatt.&#160; And Wyatt was at
Bisley, shooting with the School Eight for the Ashburton.&#160;
For bull&#8217;s-eyes as well as cats came within
Wyatt&#8217;s range as a marksman.&#160; Cricket took
up too much of his time for him to be captain of the
Eight and the man chosen to shoot for the Spencer,
as he would otherwise almost certainly have been;
but even though short of practice he was well up in
the team.</p>

<p>Until he returned, Mike could tell
nobody.&#160; And by the time he returned the notice
would probably be up in the Senior Block with the other
cricket notices.</p>

<p>In this fermenting state Mike went into the house.</p>

<p>The list of the team to play for Wain&#8217;s
<i>v</i>.&#160; Seymour&#8217;s on the following Monday
was on the board.&#160; As he passed it, a few words
scrawled in pencil at the bottom caught his eye.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;All the above will turn out
for house-fielding at 6.30 to-morrow morning.&#8212;&#173;W.&#160; F.-S.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dash it,&#8221; said Mike,
&#8220;what rot!&#160; Why on earth can&#8217;t he leave
us alone!&#8221;</p>

<p>For getting up an hour before his
customary time for rising was not among Mike&#8217;s
favourite pastimes.&#160; Still, orders were orders,
he felt.&#160; It would have to be done.</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch19">
CHAPTER XIX<br><br>
MIKE GOES TO SLEEP AGAIN</a></h3>

<p>Mike was a stout supporter of the
view that sleep in large quantities is good for one.&#160;
He belonged to the school of thought which holds that
a man becomes plain and pasty if deprived of his full
spell in bed.&#160; He aimed at the peach-bloom complexion.</p>

<p>To be routed out of bed a clear hour
before the proper time, even on a summer morning,
was not, therefore, a prospect that appealed to him.</p>

<p>When he woke it seemed even less attractive
than it had done when he went to sleep.&#160; He had
banged his head on the pillow six times over-night,
and this silent alarm proved effective, as it always
does.&#160; Reaching out a hand for his watch, he found
that it was five minutes past six.</p>

<p>This was to the good.&#160; He could
manage another quarter of an hour between the sheets.&#160;
It would only take him ten minutes to wash and get
into his flannels.</p>

<p>He took his quarter of an hour, and
a little more.&#160; He woke from a sort of doze to
find that it was twenty-five past.</p>

<p>Man&#8217;s inability to get out of
bed in the morning is a curious thing.&#160; One may
reason with oneself clearly and forcibly without the
slightest effect.&#160; One knows that delay means
inconvenience.&#160; Perhaps it may spoil one&#8217;s
whole day.&#160; And one also knows that a single resolute
heave will do the trick.&#160; But logic is of no use.&#160;
One simply lies there.</p>

<p>Mike thought he would take another minute.</p>

<p>And during that minute there floated
into his mind the question, Who <i>was</i> Firby-Smith?&#160;
That was the point.&#160; Who <i>was</i> he, after all?</p>

<p>This started quite a new train of
thought.&#160; Previously Mike had firmly intended
to get up&#8212;&#173;some time.&#160; Now he began to
waver.</p>

<p>The more he considered the Gazeka&#8217;s
insignificance and futility and his own magnificence,
the more outrageous did it seem that he should be
dragged out of bed to please Firby-Smith&#8217;s vapid
mind.&#160; Here was he, about to receive his first
eleven colours on this very day probably, being ordered
about, inconvenienced&#8212;&#173;in short, put upon
by a worm who had only just scraped into the third.</p>

<p>Was this right, he asked himself.&#160; Was this proper?</p>

<p>And the hands of the watch moved round to twenty to.</p>

<p>What was the matter with his fielding?
<i>It</i> was all right.&#160; Make the rest of the
team fag about, yes.&#160; But not a chap who, dash
it all, had got his first <i>for</i> fielding!</p>

<p>It was with almost a feeling of self-righteousness
that Mike turned over on his side and went to sleep
again.</p>

<p>And outside in the cricket-field,
the massive mind of the Gazeka was filled with rage,
as it was gradually borne in upon him that this was
not a question of mere lateness&#8212;&#173;which, he
felt, would be bad enough, for when he said six-thirty
he meant six-thirty&#8212;&#173;but of actual desertion.&#160;
It was time, he said to himself, that the foot of Authority
was set firmly down, and the strong right hand of Justice
allowed to put in some energetic work.&#160; His comments
on the team&#8217;s fielding that morning were bitter
and sarcastic.&#160; His eyes gleamed behind their
pince-nez.</p>

<p>The painful interview took place after
breakfast.&#160; The head of the house despatched his
fag in search of Mike, and waited.&#160; He paced up
and down the room like a hungry lion, adjusting his
pince-nez (a thing, by the way, which lions seldom
do) and behaving in other respects like a monarch
of the desert.&#160; One would have felt, looking at
him, that Mike, in coming to his den, was doing a deed
which would make the achievement of Daniel seem in
comparison like the tentative effort of some timid
novice.</p>

<p>And certainly Mike was not without
qualms as he knocked at the door, and went in in response
to the hoarse roar from the other side of it.</p>

<p>Firby-Smith straightened his tie, and glared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Young Jackson,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;look here, I want to know what it all means,
and jolly quick.&#160; You weren&#8217;t at house-fielding
this morning.&#160; Didn&#8217;t you see the notice?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike admitted that he had seen the notice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you frightful kid, what do you mean by
it?&#160; What?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike hesitated.&#160; Awfully embarrassing,
this.&#160; His real reason for not turning up to house-fielding
was that he considered himself above such things,
and Firby-Smith a toothy weed.&#160; Could he give this
excuse?&#160; He had not his Book of Etiquette by him
at the moment, but he rather fancied not.&#160; There
was no arguing against the fact that the head of the
house <i>was</i> a toothy weed; but he felt a firm
conviction that it would not be politic to say so.</p>

<p>Happy thought:&#160; over-slept himself.</p>

<p>He mentioned this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Over-slept yourself!&#160; You
must jolly well not over-sleep yourself.&#160; What
do you mean by over-sleeping yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>Very trying this sort of thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What time did you wake up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Six,&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>It was not according to his complicated,
yet intelligible code of morality to tell lies to
save himself.&#160; When others were concerned he could
suppress the true and suggest the false with a face
of brass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Six!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Five past.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you get up then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I went to sleep again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you went to sleep again,
did you?&#160; Well, just listen to me.&#160; I&#8217;ve
had my eye on you for some time, and I&#8217;ve seen
it coming on.&#160; You&#8217;ve got swelled head,
young man.&#160; That&#8217;s what you&#8217;ve got.&#160;
Frightful swelled head.&#160; You think the place belongs
to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Mike indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you do,&#8221; said the
Gazeka shrilly.&#160; &#8220;You think the whole frightful
place belongs to you.&#160; You go siding about as if
you&#8217;d bought it.&#160; Just because you&#8217;ve
got your second, you think you can do what you like;
turn up or not, as you please.&#160; It doesn&#8217;t
matter whether I&#8217;m only in the third and you&#8217;re
in the first.&#160; That&#8217;s got nothing to do with
it.&#160; The point is that you&#8217;re one of the
house team, and I&#8217;m captain of it, so you&#8217;ve
jolly well got to turn out for fielding with the others
when I think it necessary.&#160; See?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do&#8212;&#173;you&#8212;&#173;see, you frightful
kid?&#8221;</p>

<center><a name="illus4">
<img src="images/jmike4.jpg" alt="&#8220;DO&#8212;&#173;YOU&#8212;&#173;SEE, YOU FRIGHTFUL KID?&#8221;">
</a></center>

<p>Mike remained stonily silent.&#160;
The rather large grain of truth in what Firby-Smith
had said had gone home, as the unpleasant truth about
ourselves is apt to do; and his feelings were hurt.&#160;
He was determined not to give in and say that he saw
even if the head of the house invoked all the majesty
of the prefects&#8217; room to help him, as he had
nearly done once before.&#160; He set his teeth, and
stared at a photograph on the wall.</p>

<p>Firby-Smith&#8217;s manner became
ominously calm.&#160; He produced a swagger-stick from
a corner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see?&#8221; he asked again.</p>

<p>Mike&#8217;s jaw set more tightly.</p>

<p>What one really wants here is a row of stars.</p>

<p align="center"><br><big><big><big><b>*&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; *&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; *&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; *&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; *</b></big></big></big></p>

<p>Mike was still full of his injuries
when Wyatt came back.&#160; Wyatt was worn out, but
cheerful.&#160; The school had finished sixth for the
Ashburton, which was an improvement of eight places
on their last year&#8217;s form, and he himself had
scored thirty at the two hundred and twenty-seven
at the five hundred totals, which had put him in a
very good humour with the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me ancient skill has not deserted
me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;That&#8217;s the cats.&#160;
The man who can wing a cat by moonlight can put a
bullet where he likes on a target.&#160; I didn&#8217;t
hit the bull every time, but that was to give the
other fellows a chance.&#160; My fatal modesty has always
been a hindrance to me in life, and I suppose it always
will be.&#160; Well, well!&#160; And what of the old
homestead?&#160; Anything happened since I went away?&#160;
Me old father, is he well?&#160; Has the lost will
been discovered, or is there a mortgage on the family
estates?&#160; By Jove, I could do with a stoup of
Malvoisie.&#160; I wonder if the moke&#8217;s gone to
bed yet.&#160; I&#8217;ll go down and look.&#160; A
jug of water drawn from the well in the old courtyard
where my ancestors have played as children for centuries
back would just about save my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>He left the dormitory, and Mike began
to brood over his wrongs once more.</p>

<p>Wyatt came back, brandishing a jug
of water and a glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, for a beaker full of the
warm south, full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene!&#160;
Have you ever tasted Hippocrene, young Jackson?&#160;
Rather like ginger-beer, with a dash of raspberry-vinegar.&#160;
Very heady.&#160; Failing that, water will do.&#160;
A-ah!&#8221;</p>

<p>He put down the glass, and surveyed
Mike, who had maintained a moody silence throughout
this speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your trouble?&#8221;
he asked.&#160; &#8220;For pains in the back try Ju-jar.&#160;
If it&#8217;s a broken heart, Zam-buk&#8217;s what
you want.&#160; Who&#8217;s been quarrelling with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only that ass Firby-Smith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Again!&#160; I never saw such
chaps as you two.&#160; Always at it.&#160; What was
the trouble this time?&#160; Call him a grinning ape
again?&#160; Your passion for the truth&#8217;ll be
getting you into trouble one of these days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He said I stuck on side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean, did he buttonhole you
on your way to school, and say, &#8216;Jackson, a
word in your ear.&#160; You stick on side.&#8217;&#160;
Or did he lead up to it in any way?&#160; Did he say,
&#8216;Talking of side, you stick it on.&#8217;&#160;
What had you been doing to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the house-fielding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t stick on
side at house-fielding.&#160; I defy any one to.&#160;
It&#8217;s too early in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t turn up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#160; Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but, look here, really.&#160; Did you simply
bunk it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wyatt leaned on the end of Mike&#8217;s
bed, and, having observed its occupant thoughtfully
for a moment, proceeded to speak wisdom for the good
of his soul.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, I don&#8217;t want to
jaw&#8212;&#173;I&#8217;m one of those quiet chaps with
strong, silent natures; you may have noticed it&#8212;&#173;but
I must put in a well-chosen word at this juncture.&#160;
Don&#8217;t pretend to be dropping off to sleep.&#160;
Sit up and listen to what your kind old uncle&#8217;s
got to say to you about manners and deportment.&#160;
Otherwise, blood as you are at cricket, you&#8217;ll
have a rotten time here.&#160; There are some things
you simply can&#8217;t do; and one of them is bunking
a thing when you&#8217;re put down for it.&#160; It
doesn&#8217;t matter who it is puts you down.&#160;
If he&#8217;s captain, you&#8217;ve got to obey him.&#160;
That&#8217;s discipline, that &#8217;ere is.&#160; The
speaker then paused, and took a sip of water from the
carafe which stood at his elbow.&#160; Cheers from
the audience, and a voice &#8217;Hear!&#160; Hear!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike rolled over in bed and glared
up at the orator.&#160; Most of his face was covered
by the water-jug, but his eyes stared fixedly from
above it.&#160; He winked in a friendly way, and, putting
down the jug, drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing like this old &#8217;87
water,&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;Such body.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like you jawing about discipline,&#8221;
said Mike morosely.</p>

<p>&#8220;And why, my gentle che-ild,
should I not talk about discipline?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Considering you break out of
the house nearly every night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In passing, rather rum when
you think that a burglar would get it hot for breaking
in, while I get dropped on if I break out.&#160; Why
should there be one law for the burglar and one for
me?&#160; But you were saying&#8212;&#173;just so.&#160;
I thank you.&#160; About my breaking out.&#160; When
you&#8217;re a white-haired old man like me, young
Jackson, you&#8217;ll see that there are two sorts
of discipline at school.&#160; One you can break if
you feel like taking the risks; the other you mustn&#8217;t
ever break.&#160; I don&#8217;t know why, but it isn&#8217;t
done.&#160; Until you learn that, you can never hope
to become the Perfect Wrykynian like,&#8221; he concluded
modestly, &#8220;me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike made no reply.&#160; He would
have perished rather than admit it, but Wyatt&#8217;s
words had sunk in.&#160; That moment marked a distinct
epoch in his career.&#160; His feelings were curiously
mixed.&#160; He was still furious with Firby-Smith,
yet at the same time he could not help acknowledging
to himself that the latter had had the right on his
side.&#160; He saw and approved of Wyatt&#8217;s point
of view, which was the more impressive to him from
his knowledge of his friend&#8217;s contempt for, or,
rather, cheerful disregard of, most forms of law and
order.&#160; If Wyatt, reckless though he was as regarded
written school rules, held so rigid a respect for
those that were unwritten, these last must be things
which could not be treated lightly.&#160; That night,
for the first time in his life, Mike went to sleep
with a clear idea of what the public school spirit,
of which so much is talked and written, really meant.</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch20">
CHAPTER XX<br><br>
THE TEAM IS FILLED UP</a></h3>

<p>When Burgess, at the end of the conversation
in the pavilion with Mr. Spence which Bob Jackson
had overheard, accompanied the cricket-master across
the field to the boarding-houses, he had distinctly
made up his mind to give Mike his first eleven colours
next day.&#160; There was only one more match to be
played before the school fixture-list was finished.&#160;
That was the match with Ripton.&#160; Both at cricket
and football Ripton was the school that mattered most.&#160;
Wrykyn did not always win its other school matches;
but it generally did.&#160; The public schools of England
divide themselves naturally into little groups, as
far as games are concerned.&#160; Harrow, Eton, and
Winchester are one group:&#160; Westminster and Charterhouse
another:&#160; Bedford, Tonbridge, Dulwich, Haileybury,
and St. Paul&#8217;s are a third.&#160; In this way,
Wrykyn, Ripton, Geddington, and Wilborough formed
a group.&#160; There was no actual championship competition,
but each played each, and by the end of the season
it was easy to see which was entitled to first place.&#160;
This nearly always lay between Ripton and Wrykyn.&#160;
Sometimes an exceptional Geddington team would sweep
the board, or Wrykyn, having beaten Ripton, would
go down before Wilborough.&#160; But this did not happen
often.&#160; Usually Wilborough and Geddington were
left to scramble for the wooden spoon.</p>

<p>Secretaries of cricket at Ripton and
Wrykyn always liked to arrange the date of the match
towards the end of the term, so that they might take
the field with representative and not experimental
teams.&#160; By July the weeding-out process had generally
finished.&#160; Besides which the members of the teams
had had time to get into form.</p>

<p>At Wrykyn it was the custom to fill
up the team, if possible, before the Ripton match.&#160;
A player is likely to show better form if he has got
his colours than if his fate depends on what he does
in that particular match.</p>

<p>Burgess, accordingly, had resolved
to fill up the first eleven just a week before Ripton
visited Wrykyn.&#160; There were two vacancies.&#160;
One gave him no trouble.&#160; Neville-Smith was not
a great bowler, but he was steady, and he had done
well in the earlier matches.&#160; He had fairly earned
his place.&#160; But the choice between Bob and Mike
had kept him awake into the small hours two nights
in succession.&#160; Finally he had consulted Mr. Spence,
and Mr. Spence had voted for Mike.</p>

<p>Burgess was glad the thing was settled.&#160;
The temptation to allow sentiment to interfere with
business might have become too strong if he had waited
much longer.&#160; He knew that it would be a wrench
definitely excluding Bob from the team, and he hated
to have to do it.&#160; The more he thought of it,
the sorrier he was for him.&#160; If he could have
pleased himself, he would have kept Bob In.&#160; But,
as the poet has it, &#8220;Pleasure is pleasure, and
biz is biz, and kep&#8217; in a sepyrit jug.&#8221;&#160;
The first duty of a captain is to have no friends.</p>

<p>From small causes great events do
spring.&#160; If Burgess had not picked up a particularly
interesting novel after breakfast on the morning of
Mike&#8217;s interview with Firby-Smith in the study,
the list would have gone up on the notice-board after
prayers.&#160; As it was, engrossed in his book, he
let the moments go by till the sound on the bell startled
him into movement.&#160; And then there was only time
to gather up his cap, and sprint.&#160; The paper on
which he had intended to write the list and the pen
he had laid out to write it with lay untouched on the
table.</p>

<p>And, as it was not his habit to put
up notices except during the morning, he postponed
the thing.&#160; He could write it after tea.&#160; After
all, there was a week before the match.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>When school was over, he went across
to the Infirmary to inquire about Marsh.&#160; The
report was more than favourable.&#160; Marsh had better
not see any one just yet, In case of accident, but
he was certain to be out in time to play against Ripton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doctor Oakes thinks he will
be back in school on Tuesday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Banzai!&#8221; said Burgess,
feeling that life was good.&#160; To take the field
against Ripton without Marsh would have been to court
disaster.&#160; Marsh&#8217;s fielding alone was worth
the money.&#160; With him at short slip, Burgess felt
safe when he bowled.</p>

<p>The uncomfortable burden of the knowledge
that he was about temporarily to sour Bob Jackson&#8217;s
life ceased for the moment to trouble him.&#160; He
crooned extracts from musical comedy as he walked
towards the nets.</p>

<p>Recollection of Bob&#8217;s hard case
was brought to him by the sight of that about-to-be-soured
sportsman tearing across the ground in the middle
distance in an effort to get to a high catch which
Trevor had hit up to him.&#160; It was a difficult
catch, and Burgess waited to see if he would bring
it off.</p>

<p>Bob got to it with one hand, and held
it.&#160; His impetus carried him on almost to where
Burgess was standing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well held,&#8221; said Burgess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo,&#8221; said Bob awkwardly.&#160;
A gruesome thought had flashed across his mind that
the captain might think that this gallery-work was
an organised advertisement.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t get both hands to it,&#8221;
he explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re hot stuff in the deep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy when you&#8217;re only practising.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just been to the Infirmary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh.&#160; How&#8217;s Marsh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t let me
see him, but it&#8217;s all right.&#160; He&#8217;ll
be able to play on Saturday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Bob, hoping
he had said it as if he meant it.&#160; It was decidedly
a blow.&#160; He was glad for the sake of the school,
of course, but one has one&#8217;s personal ambitions.&#160;
To the fact that Mike and not himself was the eleventh
cap he had become partially resigned:&#160; but he
had wanted rather badly to play against Ripton.</p>

<p>Burgess passed on, his mind full of
Bob once more.&#160; What hard luck it was!&#160; There
was he, dashing about in the sun to improve his fielding,
and all the time the team was filled up.&#160; He felt
as if he were playing some low trick on a pal.</p>

<p>Then the Jekyll and Hyde business
completed itself.&#160; He suppressed his personal
feelings, and became the cricket captain again.</p>

<p>It was the cricket captain who, towards
the end of the evening, came upon Firby-Smith and
Mike parting at the conclusion of a conversation.&#160;
That it had not been a friendly conversation would
have been evident to the most casual observer from
the manner in which Mike stumped off, swinging his
cricket-bag as if it were a weapon of offence.&#160;
There are many kinds of walk.&#160; Mike&#8217;s was
the walk of the Overwrought Soul.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; inquired Burgess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Young Jackson, do you mean?&#160;
Oh, nothing.&#160; I was only telling him that there
was going to be house-fielding to-morrow before breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t he like the idea?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s jolly well got to
like it,&#8221; said the Gazeka, as who should say,
&#8220;This way for Iron Wills.&#8221;&#160; &#8220;The
frightful kid cut it this morning.&#160; There&#8217;ll
be worse trouble if he does it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was, it may be mentioned, not
an ounce of malice in the head of Wain&#8217;s house.&#160;
That by telling the captain of cricket that Mike had
shirked fielding-practice he might injure the latter&#8217;s
prospects of a first eleven cap simply did not occur
to him.&#160; That Burgess would feel, on being told
of Mike&#8217;s slackness, much as a bishop might feel
if he heard that a favourite curate had become a Mahometan
or a Mumbo-Jumboist, did not enter his mind.&#160;
All he considered was that the story of his dealings
with Mike showed him, Firby-Smith, in the favourable
and dashing character of the fellow-who-will-stand-no-nonsense,
a sort of Captain Kettle on dry land, in fact; and
so he proceeded to tell it in detail.</p>

<p>Burgess parted with him with the firm
conviction that Mike was a young slacker.&#160; Keenness
in fielding was a fetish with him; and to cut practice
struck him as a crime.</p>

<p>He felt that he had been deceived in Mike.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>When, therefore, one takes into consideration
his private bias in favour of Bob, and adds to it
the reaction caused by this sudden unmasking of Mike,
it is not surprising that the list Burgess made out
that night before he went to bed differed in an important
respect from the one he had intended to write before
school.</p>

<p>Mike happened to be near the notice-board
when he pinned it up.&#160; It was only the pleasure
of seeing his name down in black-and-white that made
him trouble to look at the list.&#160; Bob&#8217;s news
of the day before yesterday had made it clear how
that list would run.</p>

<p>The crowd that collected the moment
Burgess had walked off carried him right up to the
board.</p>

<p>He looked at the paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hard luck!&#8221; said somebody.</p>

<p>Mike scarcely heard him.</p>

<p>He felt physically sick with the shock
of the disappointment.&#160; For the initial before
the name Jackson was R.</p>

<p>There was no possibility of mistake.&#160;
Since writing was invented, there had never been an
R. that looked less like an M. than the one on that
list.</p>

<p>Bob had beaten him on the tape.</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch21">
CHAPTER XXI<br><br>
MARJORY THE FRANK</a></h3>

<p>At the door of the senior block Burgess,
going out, met Bob coming in, hurrying, as he was
rather late.</p>

<p>&#8220;Congratulate you, Bob,&#8221; he said; and
passed on.</p>

<p>Bob stared after him.&#160; As he stared, Trevor came
out of the block.</p>

<p>&#8220;Congratulate you, Bob.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you seen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seen what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why the list.&#160; You&#8217;ve got your first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My&#8212;&#173;what? you&#8217;re rotting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not.&#160; Go and look.&#8221;</p>

<p>The thing seemed incredible.&#160; Had he dreamed that
conversation between Spence and Burgess on the pavilion steps?&#160; Had
he mixed up the names?&#160; He was certain that he had heard Spence give his verdict
for Mike, and Burgess agree with him.</p>

<p>Just then, Mike, feeling very ill,
came down the steps.&#160; He caught sight of Bob and
was passing with a feeble grin, when something told
him that this was one of those occasions on which one
has to show a Red Indian fortitude and stifle one&#8217;s
private feelings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Congratulate you, Bob,&#8221; he said awkwardly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks awfully,&#8221; said
Bob, with equal awkwardness.&#160; Trevor moved on,
delicately.&#160; This was no place for him.&#160; Bob&#8217;s
face was looking like a stuffed frog&#8217;s, which
was Bob&#8217;s way of trying to appear unconcerned
and at his ease, while Mike seemed as if at any moment
he might burst into tears.&#160; Spectators are not
wanted at these awkward interviews.</p>

<p>There was a short silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jolly glad you&#8217;ve got it,&#8221; said
Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe there&#8217;s a mistake.&#160; I swear
I heard Burgess say to Spence&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He changed his mind probably.&#160; No reason
why he shouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s jolly rummy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob endeavoured to find consolation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow, you&#8217;ll have three
years in the first.&#160; You&#8217;re a cert. for next
year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hope so,&#8221; said Mike,
with such manifest lack of enthusiasm that Bob abandoned
this line of argument.&#160; When one has missed one&#8217;s
colours, next year seems a very, very long way off.</p>

<p>They moved slowly through the cloisters,
neither speaking, and up the stairs that led to the
Great Hall.&#160; Each was gratefully conscious of
the fact that prayers would be beginning in another
minute, putting an end to an uncomfortable situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heard from home lately?&#8221; inquired Mike.</p>

<p>Bob snatched gladly at the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got a letter from mother this
morning.&#160; I showed you the last one, didn&#8217;t
I?&#160; I&#8217;ve only just had time to skim through
this one, as the post was late, and I only got it
just as I was going to dash across to school.&#160;
Not much in it.&#160; Here it is, if you want to read
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks.&#160; It&#8217;ll be something to do
during Math.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marjory wrote, too, for the
first time in her life.&#160; Haven&#8217;t had time
to look at it yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After you.&#160; Sure it isn&#8217;t meant for
me?&#160; She owes me a letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s for me all right.&#160; I&#8217;ll
give it you in the interval.&#8221;</p>

<p>The arrival of the headmaster put an end to the conversation.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>By a quarter to eleven Mike had begun
to grow reconciled to his fate.&#160; The disappointment
was still there, but it was lessened.&#160; These things
are like kicks on the shin.&#160; A brief spell of agony,
and then a dull pain of which we are not always conscious
unless our attention is directed to it, and which
in time disappears altogether.&#160; When the bell
rang for the interval that morning, Mike was, as it
were, sitting up and taking nourishment.</p>

<p>He was doing this in a literal as well as in a figurative
sense when Bob entered the school shop.</p>

<p>Bob appeared curiously agitated.&#160;
He looked round, and, seeing Mike, pushed his way
towards him through the crowd.&#160; Most of those present
congratulated him as he passed; and Mike noticed, with
some surprise, that, in place of the blushful grin
which custom demands from the man who is being congratulated
on receipt of colours, there appeared on his face
a worried, even an irritated look.&#160; He seemed to
have something on his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo,&#8221; said Mike amiably.&#160; &#8220;Got
that letter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#160; I&#8217;ll show it you outside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike resented the tone, but followed.&#160;
Evidently something had happened to upset Bob seriously.&#160;
As they went out on the gravel, somebody congratulated
Bob again, and again Bob hardly seemed to appreciate
it.&#8217;</p>

<p>Bob led the way across the gravel
and on to the first terrace.&#160; When they had left
the crowd behind, he stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; asked Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to read&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jackson!&#8221;</p>

<p>They both turned.&#160; The headmaster
was standing on the edge of the gravel.</p>

<p>Bob pushed the letter into Mike&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Read that,&#8221; he said,
and went up to the headmaster.&#160; Mike heard the
words &#8220;English Essay,&#8221; and, seeing that
the conversation was apparently going to be one of
some length, capped the headmaster and walked off.&#160;
He was just going to read the letter when the bell
rang.&#160; He put the missive in his pocket, and went
to his form-room wondering what Marjory could have
found to say to Bob to touch him on the raw to such
an extent.&#160; She was a breezy correspondent, with
a style of her own, but usually she entertained rather
than upset people.&#160; No suspicion of the actual
contents of the letter crossed his mind.</p>

<p>He read it during school, under the
desk; and ceased to wonder.&#160; Bob had had cause
to look worried.&#160; For the thousand and first time
in her career of crime Marjory had been and done it!&#160;
With a strong hand she had shaken the cat out of the
bag, and exhibited it plainly to all whom it might
concern.</p>

<p>There was a curious absence of construction
about the letter.&#160; Most authors of sensational
matter nurse their bomb-shell, lead up to it, and
display it to the best advantage.&#160; Marjory dropped
hers into the body of the letter, and let it take
its chance with the other news-items.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;DEAR BOB&#8221; (the letter
ran),&#8212;&#173;</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;I hope you are quite well.&#160;
I am quite well.&#160; Phyllis has a cold, Ella
cheeked Mademoiselle yesterday, and had to write out
&#8217;Little Girls must be polite and obedient&#8217;
a hundred times in French.&#160; She was jolly sick
about it.&#160; I told her it served her right.&#160;
Joe made eighty-three against Lancashire.&#160;
Reggie made a duck.&#160; Have you got your first?&#160;
If you have, it will be all through Mike.&#160; Uncle
John told Father that Mike pretended to hurt his
wrist so that you could play instead of him for
the school, and Father said it was very sporting
of Mike but nobody must tell you because it wouldn&#8217;t
be fair if you got your first for you to know that
you owed it to Mike and I wasn&#8217;t supposed
to hear but I did because I was in the room only
they didn&#8217;t know I was (we were playing hide-and-seek
and I was hiding) so I&#8217;m writing to tell
you,</blockquote>

<p align="center">&#8220;From your affectionate sister</p>

<p align="center">&#8220;Marjory.&#8221;</p>

<p>There followed a P.S.</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what you ought
to do.&#160; I&#8217;ve been reading a jolly good book
called &#8216;The Boys of Dormitory Two,&#8217; and
the hero&#8217;s an awfully nice boy named Lionel
Tremayne, and his friend Jack Langdale saves his
life when a beast of a boatman who&#8217;s really employed
by Lionel&#8217;s cousin who wants the money that
Lionel&#8217;s going to have when he grows up stuns
him and leaves him on the beach to drown.&#160; Well,
Lionel is going to play for the school against
Loamshire, and it&#8217;s <i>the</i> match of the
season, but he goes to the headmaster and says he wants
Jack to play instead of him.&#160; Why don&#8217;t
you do that?</blockquote>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;M.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;P.P.S.&#8212;&#173;This has
been a frightful fag to write.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the life of him Mike could not
help giggling as he pictured what Bob&#8217;s expression
must have been when his brother read this document.&#160;
But the humorous side of the thing did not appeal to
him for long.&#160; What should he say to Bob?&#160;
What would Bob say to him?&#160; Dash it all, it made
him look such an awful <i>ass</i>!&#160; Anyhow, Bob
couldn&#8217;t do much.&#160; In fact he didn&#8217;t
see that he could do anything.&#160; The team was filled
up, and Burgess was not likely to alter it.&#160; Besides,
why should he alter it?&#160; Probably he would have
given Bob his colours anyhow.&#160; Still, it was beastly
awkward.&#160; Marjory meant well, but she had put her
foot right in it.&#160; Girls oughtn&#8217;t to meddle
with these things.&#160; No girl ought to be taught
to write till she came of age.&#160; And Uncle John
had behaved in many respects like the Complete Rotter.&#160;
If he was going to let out things like that, he might
at least have whispered them, or looked behind the
curtains to see that the place wasn&#8217;t chock-full
of female kids.&#160; Confound Uncle John!</p>

<p>Throughout the dinner-hour Mike kept
out of Bob&#8217;s way.&#160; But in a small community
like a school it is impossible to avoid a man for ever.&#160;
They met at the nets.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you mean?&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you read it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, is it all rot, or did
you&#8212;&#173;you know what I mean&#8212;&#173;sham
a crocked wrist?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mike, &#8220;I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob stared gloomily at his toes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean,&#8221; he said at last,
apparently putting the finishing-touch to some train
of thought, &#8220;I know I ought to be grateful, and
all that.&#160; I suppose I am.&#160; I mean it was
jolly good of you&#8212;&#173;Dash it all,&#8221; he
broke off hotly, as if the putting his position into
words had suddenly showed him how inglorious it was,
&#8220;what did you want to do it <i>for</i>?&#160;
What was the idea?&#160; What right have you got to
go about playing Providence over me?&#160; Dash it
all, it&#8217;s like giving a fellow money without
consulting him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d
ever know.&#160; You wouldn&#8217;t have if only that
ass Uncle John hadn&#8217;t let it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did he get to know?&#160; Why did you tell
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He got it out of me.&#160; I
couldn&#8217;t choke him off.&#160; He came down when
you were away at Geddington, and would insist on having
a look at my arm, and naturally he spotted right away
there was nothing the matter with it.&#160; So it came
out; that&#8217;s how it was.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob scratched thoughtfully at the turf with a spike
of his boot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, it was awfully decent&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>Then again the monstrous nature of the affair came
home to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what did you do it <i>for</i>?&#160;
Why should you rot up your own chances to give me
a look in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know....&#160; You know, you
did <i>me</i> a jolly good turn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember.&#160; When?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That Firby-Smith business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you got me out of a jolly bad hole.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, rot!&#160; And do you mean to tell me it
was simply because of that&#8212;&#8212;?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike appeared to him in a totally
new light.&#160; He stared at him as if he were some
strange creature hitherto unknown to the human race.&#160;
Mike shuffled uneasily beneath the scrutiny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow, it&#8217;s all over
now,&#8221; Mike said, &#8220;so I don&#8217;t see
what&#8217;s the point of talking about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hanged if it is.&#160;
You don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to sit tight
and take my first as if nothing had happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can you do?&#160; The list&#8217;s
up.&#160; Are you going to the Old Man to ask him if
I can play, like Lionel Tremayne?&#8221;</p>

<p>The hopelessness of the situation
came over Bob like a wave.&#160; He looked helplessly
at Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides,&#8221; added Mike,
&#8220;I shall get in next year all right.&#160; Half
a second, I just want to speak to Wyatt about something.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sidled off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, anyhow,&#8221; said Bob to himself, &#8220;I
must see Burgess about it.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch22">
CHAPTER XXII<br><br>
WYATT IS REMINDED OF AN ENGAGEMENT</a></h3>

<p>There are situations in life which
are beyond one.&#160; The sensible man realises this,
and slides out of such situations, admitting himself
beaten.&#160; Others try to grapple with them, but it
never does any good.&#160; When affairs get into a
real tangle, it is best to sit still and let them
straighten themselves out.&#160; Or, if one does not
do that, simply to think no more about them.&#160;
This is Philosophy.&#160; The true philosopher is the
man who says &#8220;All right,&#8221; and goes to sleep
in his arm-chair.&#160; One&#8217;s attitude towards
Life&#8217;s Little Difficulties should be that of
the gentleman in the fable, who sat down on an acorn
one day, and happened to doze.&#160; The warmth of
his body caused the acorn to germinate, and it grew
so rapidly that, when he awoke, he found himself sitting
in the fork of an oak, sixty feet from the ground.&#160;
He thought he would go home, but, finding this impossible,
he altered his plans.&#160; &#8220;Well, well,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;if I cannot compel circumstances to
my will, I can at least adapt my will to circumstances.&#160;
I decide to remain here.&#8221;&#160; Which he did,
and had a not unpleasant time.&#160; The oak lacked
some of the comforts of home, but the air was splendid
and the view excellent.</p>

<p>To-day&#8217;s Great Thought for Young
Readers.&#160; Imitate this man.</p>

<p>Bob should have done so, but he had
not the necessary amount of philosophy.&#160; He still
clung to the idea that he and Burgess, in council,
might find some way of making things right for everybody.&#160;
Though, at the moment, he did not see how eleven caps
were to be divided amongst twelve candidates in such
a way that each should have one.</p>

<p>And Burgess, consulted on the point,
confessed to the same inability to solve the problem.&#160;
It took Bob at least a quarter of an hour to get the
facts of the case into the captain&#8217;s head, but
at last Burgess grasped the idea of the thing.&#160;
At which period he remarked that it was a rum business.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very rum,&#8221; Bob agreed.&#160;
&#8220;Still, what you say doesn&#8217;t help us out
much, seeing that the point is, what&#8217;s to be
done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>Burgess was a philosopher, and took
the line of least resistance, like the man in the
oak-tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I must do something,&#8221;
said Bob.&#160; &#8220;Can&#8217;t you see how rotten
it is for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why.&#160;
It&#8217;s not your fault.&#160; Very sporting of your
brother and all that, of course, though I&#8217;m
blowed if I&#8217;d have done it myself; but why should
you do anything?&#160; You&#8217;re all right.&#160;
Your brother stood out of the team to let you in it,
and here you <i>are</i>, in it.&#160; What&#8217;s
he got to grumble about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not grumbling.&#160; It&#8217;s me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you?&#160; Don&#8217;t
you want your first?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not like this.&#160; Can&#8217;t you see what
a rotten position it is for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry.&#160;
You simply keep on saying you&#8217;re all right.&#160;
Besides, what do you want me to do?&#160; Alter the
list?&#8221;</p>

<p>But for the thought of those unspeakable
outsiders, Lionel Tremayne and his headmaster, Bob
might have answered this question in the affirmative;
but he had the public-school boy&#8217;s terror of
seeming to pose or do anything theatrical.&#160; He
would have done a good deal to put matters right,
but he could <i>not</i> do the self-sacrificing young
hero business.&#160; It would not be in the picture.&#160;
These things, if they are to be done at school, have
to be carried through stealthily, after Mike&#8217;s
fashion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you can&#8217;t very
well, now it&#8217;s up.&#160; Tell you what, though,
I don&#8217;t see why I shouldn&#8217;t stand out
of the team for the Ripton match.&#160; I could easily
fake up some excuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do.&#160; I don&#8217;t know
if it&#8217;s occurred to you, but the idea is rather
to win the Ripton match, if possible.&#160; So that
I&#8217;m a lot keen on putting the best team into
the field.&#160; Sorry if it upsets your arrangements
in any way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know perfectly well Mike&#8217;s
every bit as good as me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t so keen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fielding.&#160; He&#8217;s a young slacker.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Burgess had once labelled a man
as that, he did not readily let the idea out of his
mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Slacker?&#160; What rot!&#160; He&#8217;s as
keen as anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow, his keenness isn&#8217;t
enough to make him turn out for house-fielding.&#160;
If you really want to know, that&#8217;s why you&#8217;ve
got your first instead of him.&#160; You sweated away,
and improved your fielding twenty per cent.; and I
happened to be talking to Firby-Smith and found that
young Mike had been shirking his, so out he went.&#160;
A bad field&#8217;s bad enough, but a slack field wants
skinning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Smith oughtn&#8217;t to have told you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he did tell me.&#160;
So you see how it is.&#160; There won&#8217;t be any
changes from the team I&#8217;ve put up on the board.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, all right,&#8221; said
Bob.&#160; &#8220;I was afraid you mightn&#8217;t be
able to do anything.&#160; So long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mind the step,&#8221; said Burgess.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>At about the time when this conversation
was in progress, Wyatt, crossing the cricket-field
towards the school shop in search of something fizzy
that might correct a burning thirst acquired at the
nets, espied on the horizon a suit of cricket flannels
surmounted by a huge, expansive grin.&#160; As the
distance between them lessened, he discovered that
inside the flannels was Neville-Smith&#8217;s body
and behind the grin the rest of Neville-Smith&#8217;s
face.&#160; Their visit to the nets not having coincided
in point of time, as the Greek exercise books say,
Wyatt had not seen his friend since the list of the
team had been posted on the board, so he proceeded
to congratulate him on his colours.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Neville-Smith,
with a brilliant display of front teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Feeling good?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the word for it.&#160; I feel like&#8212;&#173;I
don&#8217;t know what.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what you
look like, if that&#8217;s any good to you.&#160; That
slight smile of yours will meet behind, if you don&#8217;t
look out, and then the top of your head&#8217;ll come
off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care.&#160; I&#8217;ve
got my first, whatever happens.&#160; Little Willie&#8217;s
going to buy a nice new cap and a pretty striped jacket
all for his own self!&#160; I say, thanks for reminding
me.&#160; Not that you did, but supposing you had.&#160;
At any rate, I remember what it was I wanted to say
to you.&#160; You know what I was saying to you about
the bust I meant to have at home in honour of my getting
my first, if I did, which I have&#8212;&#173;well,
anyhow it&#8217;s to-night.&#160; You can roll up, can&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Delighted.&#160; Anything for
a free feed in these hard times.&#160; What time did
you say it was?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleven.&#160; Make it a bit earlier, if you
like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, eleven&#8217;ll do me all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you going to get out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Stone walls do not a
prison make, nor iron bars a cage.&#8217;&#160; That&#8217;s
what the man said who wrote the libretto for the last
set of Latin Verses we had to do.&#160; I shall manage
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They ought to allow you a latch-key.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve often thought
of asking my pater for one.&#160; Still, I get on very
well.&#160; Who are coming besides me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No boarders.&#160; They all funked it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The race is degenerating.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Said it wasn&#8217;t good enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The school is going to the dogs.&#160; Who did
you ask?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Clowes was one.&#160; Said he
didn&#8217;t want to miss his beauty-sleep.&#160; And
Henfrey backed out because he thought the risk of being
sacked wasn&#8217;t good enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s an aspect of the
thing that might occur to some people.&#160; I don&#8217;t
blame him&#8212;&#173;I might feel like that myself
if I&#8217;d got another couple of years at school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But one or two day-boys are
coming.&#160; Clephane is, for one.&#160; And Beverley.&#160;
We shall have rather a rag.&#160; I&#8217;m going to
get the things now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I get to your place&#8212;&#173;I
don&#8217;t believe I know the way, now I come to
think of it&#8212;&#173;what do I do?&#160; Ring the
bell and send in my card? or smash the nearest window
and climb in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make too much row,
for goodness sake.&#160; All the servants&#8217;ll have
gone to bed.&#160; You&#8217;ll see the window of my
room.&#160; It&#8217;s just above the porch.&#160; It&#8217;ll
be the only one lighted up.&#160; Heave a pebble at
it, and I&#8217;ll come down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So will the glass&#8212;&#173;with
a run, I expect.&#160; Still, I&#8217;ll try to do as
little damage as possible.&#160; After all, I needn&#8217;t
throw a brick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>will</i> turn up, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing shall stop me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good man.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Wyatt was turning away, a sudden
compunction seized upon Neville-Smith.&#160; He called
him back.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, you don&#8217;t think
it&#8217;s too risky, do you?&#160; I mean, you always
are breaking out at night, aren&#8217;t you?&#160;
I don&#8217;t want to get you into a row.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right,&#8221;
said Wyatt.&#160; &#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry about
me.&#160; I should have gone out anyhow to-night.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch23">
CHAPTER XXIII<br><br>
A SURPRISE FOR MR. APPLEBY</a></h3>

<p>&#8220;You may not know it,&#8221;
said Wyatt to Mike in the dormitory that night, &#8220;but
this is the maddest, merriest day of all the glad New
Year.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike could not help thinking that
for himself it was the very reverse, but he did not
state his view of the case.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neville-Smith&#8217;s giving
a meal at his place in honour of his getting his first.&#160;
I understand the preparations are on a scale of the
utmost magnificence.&#160; No expense has been spared.&#160;
Ginger-beer will flow like water.&#160; The oldest
cask of lemonade has been broached; and a sardine is
roasting whole in the market-place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I can tear myself away from
your delightful society.&#160; The kick-off is fixed
for eleven sharp.&#160; I am to stand underneath his
window and heave bricks till something happens.&#160;
I don&#8217;t know if he keeps a dog.&#160; If so,
I shall probably get bitten to the bone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When are you going to start?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About five minutes after Wain
has been round the dormitories to see that all&#8217;s
well.&#160; That ought to be somewhere about half-past
ten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go getting caught.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall do my little best not
to be.&#160; Rather tricky work, though, getting back.&#160;
I&#8217;ve got to climb two garden walls, and I shall
probably be so full of Malvoisie that you&#8217;ll
be able to hear it swishing about inside me.&#160;
No catch steeple-chasing if you&#8217;re like that.&#160;
They&#8217;ve no thought for people&#8217;s convenience
here.&#160; Now at Bradford they&#8217;ve got studies
on the ground floor, the windows looking out over the
boundless prairie.&#160; No climbing or steeple-chasing
needed at all.&#160; All you have to do is to open
the window and step out.&#160; Still, we must make
the best of things.&#160; Push us over a pinch of that
tooth-powder of yours.&#160; I&#8217;ve used all mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wyatt very seldom penetrated further
than his own garden on the occasions when he roamed
abroad at night.&#160; For cat-shooting the Wain spinneys
were unsurpassed.&#160; There was one particular dustbin
where one might be certain of flushing a covey any
night; and the wall by the potting-shed was a feline
club-house.</p>

<p>But when he did wish to get out into
the open country he had a special route which he always
took.&#160; He climbed down from the wall that ran
beneath the dormitory window into the garden belonging
to Mr. Appleby, the master who had the house next
to Mr. Wain&#8217;s.&#160; Crossing this, he climbed
another wall, and dropped from it into a small lane
which ended in the main road leading to Wrykyn town.</p>

<p>This was the route which he took to-night.&#160;
It was a glorious July night, and the scent of the
flowers came to him with a curious distinctness as
he let himself down from the dormitory window.&#160;
At any other time he might have made a lengthy halt,
and enjoyed the scents and small summer noises, but
now he felt that it would be better not to delay.&#160;
There was a full moon, and where he stood he could
be seen distinctly from the windows of both houses.&#160;
They were all dark, it is true, but on these occasions
it was best to take no risks.</p>

<p>He dropped cautiously into Appleby&#8217;s
garden, ran lightly across it, and was in the lane
within a minute.</p>

<p>There he paused, dusted his trousers,
which had suffered on the two walls, and strolled
meditatively in the direction of the town.&#160; Half-past
ten had just chimed from the school clock.&#160; He
was in plenty of time.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a night!&#8221; he said
to himself, sniffing as he walked.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>Now it happened that he was not alone
in admiring the beauty of that particular night.&#160;
At ten-fifteen it had struck Mr. Appleby, looking
out of his study into the moonlit school grounds, that
a pipe in the open would make an excellent break in
his night&#8217;s work.&#160; He had acquired a slight
headache as the result of correcting a batch of examination
papers, and he thought that an interval of an hour
in the open air before approaching the half-dozen
or so papers which still remained to be looked at
might do him good.&#160; The window of his study was
open, but the room had got hot and stuffy.&#160; Nothing
like a little fresh air for putting him right.</p>

<p>For a few moments he debated the rival
claims of a stroll in the cricket-field and a seat
in the garden.&#160; Then he decided on the latter.&#160;
The little gate in the railings opposite his house
might not be open, and it was a long way round to
the main entrance.&#160; So he took a deck-chair which
leaned against the wall, and let himself out of the
back door.</p>

<p>He took up his position in the shadow
of a fir-tree with his back to the house.&#160; From
here he could see the long garden.&#160; He was fond
of his garden, and spent what few moments he could
spare from work and games pottering about it.&#160;
He had his views as to what the ideal garden should
be, and he hoped in time to tinker his own three acres
up to the desired standard.&#160; At present there
remained much to be done.&#160; Why not, for instance,
take away those laurels at the end of the lawn, and
have a flower-bed there instead?&#160; Laurels lasted
all the year round, true, whereas flowers died and
left an empty brown bed in the winter, but then laurels
were nothing much to look at at any time, and a garden
always had a beastly appearance in winter, whatever
you did to it.&#160; Much better have flowers, and
get a decent show for one&#8217;s money in summer
at any rate.</p>

<p>The problem of the bed at the end
of the lawn occupied his complete attention for more
than a quarter of an hour, at the end of which period
he discovered that his pipe had gone out.</p>

<p>He was just feeling for his matches
to relight it when Wyatt dropped with a slight thud
into his favourite herbaceous border.</p>

<p>The surprise, and the agony of feeling
that large boots were trampling among his treasures
kept him transfixed for just the length of time necessary
for Wyatt to cross the garden and climb the opposite
wall.&#160; As he dropped into the lane, Mr. Appleby
recovered himself sufficiently to emit a sort of strangled
croak, but the sound was too slight to reach Wyatt.&#160;
That reveller was walking down the Wrykyn road before
Mr. Appleby had left his chair.</p>

<p>It is an interesting point that it
was the gardener rather than the schoolmaster in Mr.
Appleby that first awoke to action.&#160; It was not
the idea of a boy breaking out of his house at night
that occurred to him first as particularly heinous;
it was the fact that the boy had broken out <i>via</i>
his herbaceous border.&#160; In four strides he was
on the scene of the outrage, examining, on hands and
knees, with the aid of the moonlight, the extent of
the damage done.</p>

<p>As far as he could see, it was not
serious.&#160; By a happy accident Wyatt&#8217;s boots
had gone home to right and left of precious plants
but not on them.&#160; With a sigh of relief Mr. Appleby
smoothed over the cavities, and rose to his feet.</p>

<p>At this point it began to strike him
that the episode affected him as a schoolmaster also.</p>

<p>In that startled moment when Wyatt
had suddenly crossed his line of vision, he had recognised
him.&#160; The moon had shone full on his face as he
left the flowerbed.&#160; There was no doubt in his
mind as to the identity of the intruder.</p>

<p>He paused, wondering how he should
act.&#160; It was not an easy question.&#160; There
was nothing of the spy about Mr. Appleby.&#160; He went
his way openly, liked and respected by boys and masters.&#160;
He always played the game.&#160; The difficulty here
was to say exactly what the game was.&#160; Sentiment,
of course, bade him forget the episode, treat it as
if it had never happened.&#160; That was the simple
way out of the difficulty.&#160; There was nothing
unsporting about Mr. Appleby.&#160; He knew that there
were times when a master might, without blame, close
his eyes or look the other way.&#160; If he had met
Wyatt out of bounds in the day-time, and it had been
possible to convey the impression that he had not seen
him, he would have done so.&#160; To be out of bounds
is not a particularly deadly sin.&#160; A master must
check it if it occurs too frequently, but he may use
his discretion.</p>

<p>Breaking out at night, however, was
a different thing altogether.&#160; It was on another
plane.&#160; There are times when a master must waive
sentiment, and remember that he is in a position of
trust, and owes a duty directly to his headmaster,
and indirectly, through the headmaster, to the parents.&#160;
He receives a salary for doing this duty, and, if
he feels that sentiment is too strong for him, he should
resign in favour of some one of tougher fibre.</p>

<p>This was the conclusion to which Mr.
Appleby came over his relighted pipe.&#160; He could
not let the matter rest where it was.</p>

<p>In ordinary circumstances it would
have been his duty to report the affair to the headmaster
but in the present case he thought that a slightly
different course might be pursued.&#160; He would lay
the whole thing before Mr. Wain, and leave him to
deal with it as he thought best.&#160; It was one of
the few cases where it was possible for an assistant
master to fulfil his duty to a parent directly, instead
of through the agency of the headmaster.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>Knocking out the ashes of his pipe
against a tree, he folded his deck-chair and went
into the house.&#160; The examination papers were spread
invitingly on the table, but they would have to wait.&#160;
He turned down his lamp, and walked round to Wain&#8217;s.</p>

<p>There was a light in one of the ground-floor
windows.&#160; He tapped on the window, and the sound
of a chair being pushed back told him that he had
been heard.&#160; The blind shot up, and he had a view
of a room littered with books and papers, in the middle
of which stood Mr. Wain, like a sea-beast among rocks.</p>

<p>Mr. Wain recognised his visitor and
opened the window.&#160; Mr. Appleby could not help
feeling how like Wain it was to work on a warm summer&#8217;s
night in a hermetically sealed room.&#160; There was
always something queer and eccentric about Wyatt&#8217;s
step-father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I have a word with you, Wain?&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Appleby!&#160; Is there anything
the matter?&#160; I was startled when you tapped.&#160;
Exceedingly so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; said Mr. Appleby.&#160;
&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t have disturbed you, only it&#8217;s
something important.&#160; I&#8217;ll climb in through
here, shall I?&#160; No need to unlock the door.&#8221;&#160;
And, greatly to Mr. Wain&#8217;s surprise and rather
to his disapproval, Mr. Appleby vaulted on to the
window-sill, and squeezed through into the room.</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch24">
CHAPTER XXIV<br><br>
CAUGHT</a></h3>

<p>&#8220;Got some rather bad news for
you, I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; began Mr. Appleby.&#160;
&#8220;I&#8217;ll smoke, if you don&#8217;t mind.&#160;
About Wyatt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;James!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was sitting in my garden
a few minutes ago, having a pipe before finishing
the rest of my papers, and Wyatt dropped from the wall
on to my herbaceous border.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Appleby said this with a tinge
of bitterness.&#160; The thing still rankled.</p>

<p>&#8220;James!&#160; In your garden!&#160;
Impossible.&#160; Why, it is not a quarter of an hour
since I left him in his dormitory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not there now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You astound me, Appleby.&#160; I am astonished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So was I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How is such a thing possible?&#160; His window
is heavily barred.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bars can be removed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have been mistaken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly,&#8221; said Mr. Appleby,
a little nettled.&#160; Gaping astonishment is always
apt to be irritating.&#160; &#8220;Let&#8217;s leave
it at that, then.&#160; Sorry to have disturbed you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sit down, Appleby.&#160;
Dear me, this is most extraordinary.&#160; Exceedingly
so.&#160; You are certain it was James?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly.&#160; It&#8217;s like daylight out
of doors.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Wain drummed on the table with his fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Appleby offered no suggestion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to report it to the
headmaster.&#160; That is certainly the course I should
pursue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why.&#160;
It isn&#8217;t like an ordinary case.&#160; You&#8217;re
the parent.&#160; You can deal with the thing directly.&#160;
If you come to think of it, a headmaster&#8217;s only
a sort of middleman between boys and parents.&#160;
He plays substitute for the parent in his absence.&#160;
I don&#8217;t see why you should drag in the master
at all here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is certainly something
in what you say,&#8221; said Mr. Wain on reflection.</p>

<p>&#8220;A good deal.&#160; Tackle the
boy when he comes in, and have it out with him.&#160;
Remember that it must mean expulsion if you report
him to the headmaster.&#160; He would have no choice.&#160;
Everybody who has ever broken out of his house here
and been caught has been expelled.&#160; I should strongly
advise you to deal with the thing yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will.&#160; Yes.&#160; You
are quite right, Appleby.&#160; That is a very good
idea of yours.&#160; You are not going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Must.&#160; Got a pile of examination
papers to look over.&#160; Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Appleby made his way out of the
window and through the gate into his own territory
in a pensive frame of mind.&#160; He was wondering what
would happen.&#160; He had taken the only possible course,
and, if only Wain kept his head and did not let the
matter get through officially to the headmaster, things
might not be so bad for Wyatt after all.&#160; He hoped
they would not.&#160; He liked Wyatt.&#160; It would
be a thousand pities, he felt, if he were to be expelled.&#160;
What would Wain do?&#160; What would <i>he</i> do in
a similar case?&#160; It was difficult to say.&#160;
Probably talk violently for as long as he could keep
it up, and then consider the episode closed.&#160;
He doubted whether Wain would have the common sense
to do this.&#160; Altogether it was very painful and
disturbing, and he was taking a rather gloomy view
of the assistant master&#8217;s lot as he sat down
to finish off the rest of his examination papers.&#160;
It was not all roses, the life of an assistant master
at a public school.&#160; He had continually to be
sinking his own individual sympathies in the claims
of his duty.&#160; Mr. Appleby was the last man who
would willingly have reported a boy for enjoying a
midnight ramble.&#160; But he was the last man to shirk
the duty of reporting him, merely because it was one
decidedly not to his taste.</p>

<p>Mr. Wain sat on for some minutes after
his companion had left, pondering over the news he
had heard.&#160; Even now he clung to the idea that
Appleby had made some extraordinary mistake.&#160; Gradually
he began to convince himself of this.&#160; He had
seen Wyatt actually in bed a quarter of an hour before&#8212;&#173;not
asleep, it was true, but apparently on the verge of
dropping off.&#160; And the bars across the window had
looked so solid....&#160; Could Appleby have been dreaming?&#160;
Something of the kind might easily have happened.&#160;
He had been working hard, and the night was warm....</p>

<p>Then it occurred to him that he could
easily prove or disprove the truth of his colleague&#8217;s
statement by going to the dormitory and seeing if
Wyatt were there or not.&#160; If he had gone out, he
would hardly have returned yet.</p>

<p>He took a candle, and walked quietly upstairs.</p>

<p>Arrived at his step-son&#8217;s dormitory,
he turned the door-handle softly and went in.&#160;
The light of the candle fell on both beds.&#160; Mike
was there, asleep.&#160; He grunted, and turned over
with his face to the wall as the light shone on his
eyes.&#160; But the other bed was empty.&#160; Appleby
had been right.</p>

<p>If further proof had been needed,
one of the bars was missing from the window.&#160;
The moon shone in through the empty space.</p>

<p>The house-master sat down quietly
on the vacant bed.&#160; He blew the candle out, and
waited there in the semi-darkness, thinking.&#160; For
years he and Wyatt had lived in a state of armed neutrality,
broken by various small encounters.&#160; Lately, by
silent but mutual agreement, they had kept out of
each other&#8217;s way as much as possible, and it
had become rare for the house-master to have to find
fault officially with his step-son.&#160; But there
had never been anything even remotely approaching
friendship between them.&#160; Mr. Wain was not a man
who inspired affection readily, least of all in those
many years younger than himself.&#160; Nor did he easily
grow fond of others.&#160; Wyatt he had regarded, from
the moment when the threads of their lives became
entangled, as a complete nuisance.</p>

<p>It was not, therefore, a sorrowful,
so much as an exasperated, vigil that he kept in the
dormitory.&#160; There was nothing of the sorrowing
father about his frame of mind.&#160; He was the house-master
about to deal with a mutineer, and nothing else.</p>

<p>This breaking-out, he reflected wrathfully,
was the last straw.&#160; Wyatt&#8217;s presence had
been a nervous inconvenience to him for years.&#160;
The time had come to put an end to it.&#160; It was
with a comfortable feeling of magnanimity that he
resolved not to report the breach of discipline to
the headmaster.&#160; Wyatt should not be expelled.&#160;
But he should leave, and that immediately.&#160; He
would write to the bank before he went to bed, asking
them to receive his step-son at once; and the letter
should go by the first post next day.&#160; The discipline
of the bank would be salutary and steadying.&#160;
And&#8212;&#173;this was a particularly grateful reflection&#8212;&#173;a
fortnight annually was the limit of the holiday allowed
by the management to its junior employees.</p>

<p>Mr. Wain had arrived at this conclusion,
and was beginning to feel a little cramped, when Mike
Jackson suddenly sat up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo!&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to sleep, Jackson, immediately,&#8221; snapped
the house-master.</p>

<p>Mike had often heard and read of people&#8217;s
hearts leaping to their mouths, but he had never before
experienced that sensation of something hot and dry
springing in the throat, which is what really happens
to us on receipt of a bad shock.&#160; A sickening feeling
that the game was up beyond all hope of salvation
came to him.&#160; He lay down again without a word.</p>

<p>What a frightful thing to happen!&#160;
How on earth had this come about?&#160; What in the
world had brought Wain to the dormitory at that hour?&#160;
Poor old Wyatt!&#160; If it had upset <i>him</i> (Mike)
to see the house-master in the room, what would be
the effect of such a sight on Wyatt, returning from
the revels at Neville-Smith&#8217;s!</p>

<p>And what could he do?&#160; Nothing.&#160;
There was literally no way out.&#160; His mind went
back to the night when he had saved Wyatt by a brilliant
<i>coup</i>.&#160; The most brilliant of <i>coups</i>
could effect nothing now.&#160; Absolutely and entirely
the game was up.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>Every minute that passed seemed like
an hour to Mike.&#160; Dead silence reigned in the
dormitory, broken every now and then by the creak of
the other bed, as the house-master shifted his position.&#160;
Twelve boomed across the field from the school clock.&#160;
Mike could not help thinking what a perfect night
it must be for him to be able to hear the strokes
so plainly.&#160; He strained his ears for any indication
of Wyatt&#8217;s approach, but could hear nothing.&#160;
Then a very faint scraping noise broke the stillness,
and presently the patch of moonlight on the floor
was darkened.</p>

<p>At that moment Mr. Wain relit his candle.</p>

<p>The unexpected glare took Wyatt momentarily
aback.&#160; Mike saw him start.&#160; Then he seemed
to recover himself.&#160; In a calm and leisurely manner
he climbed into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;James!&#8221; said Mr. Wain.&#160;
His voice sounded ominously hollow.</p>

<p>Wyatt dusted his knees, and rubbed
his hands together.&#160; &#8220;Hullo, is that you,
father!&#8221; he said pleasantly.</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch25">
CHAPTER XXV<br><br>
MARCHING ORDERS</a></h3>

<p>A silence followed.&#160; To Mike,
lying in bed, holding his breath, it seemed a long
silence.&#160; As a matter of fact it lasted for perhaps
ten seconds.&#160; Then Mr. Wain spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been out, James?&#8221;</p>

<p>It is curious how in the more dramatic
moments of life the inane remark is the first that
comes to us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said Wyatt.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am astonished.&#160; Exceedingly astonished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I got a bit of a start myself,&#8221; said
Wyatt.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall talk to you in my study.&#160; Follow
me there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>He left the room, and Wyatt suddenly began to chuckle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Wyatt!&#8221; said Mike,
completely thrown off his balance by the events of
the night.</p>

<p>Wyatt continued to giggle helplessly.&#160;
He flung himself down on his bed, rolling with laughter.&#160;
Mike began to get alarmed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221;
said Wyatt at last, speaking with difficulty.&#160;
&#8220;But, I say, how long had he been sitting there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seemed hours.&#160; About an hour, I suppose,
really.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the funniest thing
I&#8217;ve ever struck.&#160; Me sweating to get in
quietly, and all the time him camping out on my bed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But look here, what&#8217;ll happen?&#8221;</p>

<p>Wyatt sat up.</p>

<p>&#8220;That reminds me.&#160; Suppose I&#8217;d better
go down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll he do, do you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, now, what!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, I say, it&#8217;s awful.&#160; What&#8217;ll
happen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s for him to decide.&#160; Speaking
at a venture, I should say&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think&#8212;&#8212;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The boot.&#160; The swift and
sudden boot.&#160; I shall be sorry to part with you,
but I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s a case of &#8216;Au
revoir, my little Hyacinth.&#8217;&#160; We shall meet
at Philippi.&#160; This is my Moscow.&#160; To-morrow
I shall go out into the night with one long, choking
sob.&#160; Years hence a white-haired bank-clerk will
tap at your door when you&#8217;re a prosperous professional
cricketer with your photograph in <i>Wisden</i>.&#160;
That&#8217;ll be me.&#160; Well, I suppose I&#8217;d
better go down.&#160; We&#8217;d better all get to bed
<i>some</i> time to-night.&#160; Don&#8217;t go to
sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not likely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you all the
latest news when I come back.&#160; Where are me slippers?&#160;
Ha, &#8217;tis well!&#160; Lead on, then, minions.&#160;
I follow.&#8221;</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>In the study Mr. Wain was fumbling
restlessly with his papers when Wyatt appeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, James,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Wyatt sat down.&#160; One of his slippers
fell off with a clatter.&#160; Mr. Wain jumped nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only my slipper,&#8221; explained Wyatt.&#160;
&#8220;It slipped.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Wain took up a pen, and began to tap the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, James?&#8221;</p>

<p>Wyatt said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be glad to hear your
explanation of this disgraceful matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fact is&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221; said
Wyatt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t one, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What were you doing out of
your dormitory, out of the house, at that hour?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I went for a walk, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, may I inquire, are you
in the habit of violating the strictest school rules
by absenting yourself from the house during the night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is an exceedingly serious matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wyatt nodded agreement with this view.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exceedingly.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pen rose and fell with the rapidity
of the cylinder of a motor-car.&#160; Wyatt, watching
it, became suddenly aware that the thing was hypnotising
him.&#160; In a minute or two he would be asleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you wouldn&#8217;t do
that, father.&#160; Tap like that, I mean.&#160; It&#8217;s
sending me to sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;James!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like a woodpecker.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Studied impertinence&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry.&#160; Only it <i>was</i>
sending me off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Wain suspended tapping operations,
and resumed the thread of his discourse.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry, exceedingly, to
see this attitude in you, James.&#160; It is not fitting.&#160;
It is in keeping with your behaviour throughout.&#160;
Your conduct has been lax and reckless in the extreme.&#160;
It is possible that you imagine that the peculiar
circumstances of our relationship secure you from
the penalties to which the ordinary boy&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I need hardly say,&#8221; continued
Mr. Wain, ignoring the interruption, &#8220;that I
shall treat you exactly as I should treat any other
member of my house whom I had detected in the same
misdemeanour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Wyatt, approvingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must ask you not to interrupt
me when I am speaking to you, James.&#160; I say that
your punishment will be no whit less severe than would
be that of any other boy.&#160; You have repeatedly
proved yourself lacking in ballast and a respect for
discipline in smaller ways, but this is a far more
serious matter.&#160; Exceedingly so.&#160; It is impossible
for me to overlook it, even were I disposed to do
so.&#160; You are aware of the penalty for such an
action as yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The sack,&#8221; said Wyatt laconically.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is expulsion.&#160; You must leave the school.&#160;
At once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wyatt nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you know, I have already
secured a nomination for you in the London and Oriental
Bank.&#160; I shall write to-morrow to the manager
asking him to receive you at once&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After all, they only gain an extra fortnight
of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will leave directly I receive
his letter.&#160; I shall arrange with the headmaster
that you are withdrawn privately&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Not</i> the sack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Withdrawn privately.&#160; You
will not go to school to-morrow.&#160; Do you understand?&#160;
That is all.&#160; Have you anything to say?&#8221;</p>

<p>Wyatt reflected.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>His eye fell on a tray bearing a decanter and a syphon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; he said.&#160;
&#8220;Can&#8217;t I mix you a whisky and soda, father,
before I go off to bed?&#8221;</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>Wyatt kicked off his slippers, and began to undress.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We chatted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has he let you off?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like a gun.&#160; I shoot off
almost immediately.&#160; To-morrow I take a well-earned
rest away from school, and the day after I become the
gay young bank-clerk, all amongst the ink and ledgers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike was miserably silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Buck up,&#8221; said Wyatt
cheerfully.&#160; &#8220;It would have happened anyhow
in another fortnight.&#160; So why worry?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike was still silent.&#160; The reflection
was doubtless philosophic, but it failed to comfort
him.</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch26">
CHAPTER XXVI<br><br>
THE AFTERMATH</a></h3>

<p>Bad news spreads quickly.&#160; By
the quarter to eleven interval next day the facts
concerning Wyatt and Mr. Wain were public property.&#160;
Mike, as an actual spectator of the drama, was in
great request as an informant.&#160; As he told the
story to a group of sympathisers outside the school
shop, Burgess came up, his eyes rolling in a fine frenzy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anybody seen young&#8212;&#173;oh,
here you are.&#160; What&#8217;s all this about Jimmy
Wyatt?&#160; They&#8217;re saying he&#8217;s been sacked,
or some rot.&#8221;</p>

<center><a name="illus5">
<img src="images/jmike5.jpg" alt="&#8220;WHAT&#8217;S ALL THIS ABOUT JIMMY WYATT?&#8221;">
</a></center>

<p>&#8220;So he has&#8212;&#173;at least, he&#8217;s got
to leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#160; When?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s left already.&#160; He isn&#8217;t
coming to school again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Burgess&#8217;s first thought, as
befitted a good cricket captain, was for his team.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the Ripton match on Saturday!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nobody seemed to have anything except silent sympathy
at his command.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dash the man!&#160; Silly ass!&#160;
What did he want to do it for!&#160; Poor old Jimmy,
though!&#8221; he added after a pause.&#160; &#8220;What
rot for him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beastly,&#8221; agreed Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the same,&#8221; continued
Burgess, with a return to the austere manner of the
captain of cricket, &#8220;he might have chucked playing
the goat till after the Ripton match.&#160; Look here,
young Jackson, you&#8217;ll turn out for fielding
with the first this afternoon.&#160; You&#8217;ll play
on Saturday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Mike,
without enthusiasm.&#160; The Wyatt disaster was too
recent for him to feel much pleasure at playing against
Ripton <i>vice</i> his friend, withdrawn.</p>

<p>Bob was the next to interview him.&#160;
They met in the cloisters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, Mike!&#8221; said Bob.&#160;
&#8220;I say, what&#8217;s all this about Wyatt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wain caught him getting back
into the dorm. last night after Neville-Smith&#8217;s,
and he&#8217;s taken him away from the school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he going to do?&#160;
Going into that bank straight away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#160; You know, that&#8217;s
the part he bars most.&#160; He&#8217;d have been leaving
anyhow in a fortnight, you see; only it&#8217;s awful
rot for a chap like Wyatt to have to go and froust
in a bank for the rest of his life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll find it rather
a change, I expect.&#160; I suppose you won&#8217;t
be seeing him before he goes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t think so.&#160;
Not unless he comes to the dorm. during the night.&#160;
He&#8217;s sleeping over in Wain&#8217;s part of the
house, but I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised if he nipped
out after Wain has gone to bed.&#160; Hope he does,
anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to say good-bye.&#160;
But I don&#8217;t suppose it&#8217;ll be possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>They separated in the direction of
their respective form-rooms.&#160; Mike felt bitter
and disappointed at the way the news had been received.&#160;
Wyatt was his best friend, his pal; and it offended
him that the school should take the tidings of his
departure as they had done.&#160; Most of them who
had come to him for information had expressed a sort
of sympathy with the absent hero of his story, but
the chief sensation seemed to be one of pleasurable
excitement at the fact that something big had happened
to break the monotony of school routine.&#160; They
treated the thing much as they would have treated
the announcement that a record score had been made
in first-class cricket.&#160; The school was not so
much regretful as comfortably thrilled.&#160; And Burgess
had actually cursed before sympathising.&#160; Mike
felt resentful towards Burgess.&#160; As a matter of
fact, the cricket captain wrote a letter to Wyatt during
preparation that night which would have satisfied even
Mike&#8217;s sense of what was fit.&#160; But Mike
had no opportunity of learning this.</p>

<p>There was, however, one exception
to the general rule, one member of the school who
did not treat the episode as if it were merely an
interesting and impersonal item of sensational news.&#160;
Neville-Smith heard of what had happened towards the
end of the interval, and rushed off instantly in search
of Mike.&#160; He was too late to catch him before
he went to his form-room, so he waited for him at half-past
twelve, when the bell rang for the end of morning
school.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Jackson, is this true about old Wyatt?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike related the story for the sixteenth
time.&#160; It was a melancholy pleasure to have found
a listener who heard the tale in the right spirit.&#160;
There was no doubt about Neville-Smith&#8217;s interest
and sympathy.&#160; He was silent for a moment after
Mike had finished.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was all my fault,&#8221;
he said at length.&#160; &#8220;If it hadn&#8217;t been
for me, this wouldn&#8217;t have happened.&#160; What
a fool I was to ask him to my place!&#160; I might
have known he would be caught.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was absolutely my fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike was not equal to the task of
soothing Neville-Smith&#8217;s wounded conscience.&#160;
He did not attempt it.&#160; They walked on without
further conversation till they reached Wain&#8217;s
gate, where Mike left him.&#160; Neville-Smith proceeded
on his way, plunged in meditation.</p>

<p>The result of which meditation was
that Burgess got a second shock before the day was
out.&#160; Bob, going over to the nets rather late in
the afternoon, came upon the captain of cricket standing
apart from his fellow men with an expression on his
face that spoke of mental upheavals on a vast scale.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; asked Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing much,&#8221; said Burgess,
with a forced and grisly calm.&#160; &#8220;Only that,
as far as I can see, we shall play Ripton on Saturday
with a sort of second eleven.&#160; You don&#8217;t
happen to have got sacked or anything, by the way,
do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happened now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neville-Smith.&#160; In extra
on Saturday.&#160; That&#8217;s all.&#160; Only our first-
and second-change bowlers out of the team for the
Ripton match in one day.&#160; I suppose by to-morrow
half the others&#8217;ll have gone, and we shall take
the field on Saturday with a scratch side of kids from
the Junior School.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neville-Smith!&#160; Why, what&#8217;s he been
doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Apparently he gave a sort of
supper to celebrate his getting his first, and it
was while coming back from that that Wyatt got collared.&#160;
Well, I&#8217;m blowed if Neville-Smith doesn&#8217;t
toddle off to the Old Man after school to-day and
tell him the whole yarn!&#160; Said it was all his
fault.&#160; What rot!&#160; Sort of thing that might
have happened to any one.&#160; If Wyatt hadn&#8217;t
gone to him, he&#8217;d probably have gone out somewhere
else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the Old Man shoved him in extra?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Next two Saturdays.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are Ripton strong this year?&#8221;
asked Bob, for lack of anything better to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very, from all accounts.&#160;
They whacked the M.C.C.&#160; Jolly hot team of M.C.C.
too.&#160; Stronger than the one we drew with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, you never know what&#8217;s
going to happen at cricket.&#160; I may hold a catch
for a change.&#8221;</p>

<p>Burgess grunted.</p>

<p>Bob went on his way to the nets.&#160; Mike was just
putting on his pads.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Mike,&#8221; said Bob.&#160;
&#8220;I wanted to see you.&#160; It&#8217;s about Wyatt.&#160;
I&#8217;ve thought of something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A way of getting him out of
that bank.&#160; If it comes off, that&#8217;s to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, he&#8217;d jump at anything.&#160;
What&#8217;s the idea?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t he get
a job of sorts out in the Argentine?&#160; There ought
to be heaps of sound jobs going there for a chap like
Wyatt.&#160; He&#8217;s a jolly good shot, to start
with.&#160; I shouldn&#8217;t wonder if it wasn&#8217;t
rather a score to be able to shoot out there.&#160;
And he can ride, I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, I&#8217;ll write to
father to-night.&#160; He must be able to work it, I
should think.&#160; He never chucked the show altogether,
did he?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike, as most other boys of his age
would have been, was profoundly ignorant as to the
details by which his father&#8217;s money had been,
or was being, made.&#160; He only knew vaguely that
the source of revenue had something to do with the
Argentine.&#160; His brother Joe had been born in Buenos
Ayres; and once, three years ago, his father had gone
over there for a visit, presumably on business.&#160;
All these things seemed to show that Mr. Jackson senior
was a useful man to have about if you wanted a job
in that Eldorado, the Argentine Republic.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Mike&#8217;s
father owned vast tracts of land up country, where
countless sheep lived and had their being.&#160; He
had long retired from active superintendence of his
estate.&#160; Like Mr. Spenlow, he had a partner, a
stout fellow with the work-taint highly developed,
who asked nothing better than to be left in charge.&#160;
So Mr. Jackson had returned to the home of his fathers,
glad to be there again.&#160; But he still had a decided
voice in the ordering of affairs on the ranches, and
Mike was going to the fountain-head of things when
he wrote to his father that night, putting forward
Wyatt&#8217;s claims to attention and ability to perform
any sort of job with which he might be presented.</p>

<p>The reflection that he had done all
that could be done tended to console him for the non-appearance
of Wyatt either that night or next morning&#8212;&#173;a
non-appearance which was due to the simple fact that
he passed that night in a bed in Mr. Wain&#8217;s
dressing-room, the door of which that cautious pedagogue,
who believed in taking no chances, locked from the
outside on retiring to rest.</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch27">
CHAPTER XXVII<br><br>
THE RIPTON MATCH</a></h3>

<p>Mike got an answer from his father
on the morning of the Ripton match.&#160; A letter
from Wyatt also lay on his plate when he came down
to breakfast.</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson&#8217;s letter was short,
but to the point.&#160; He said he would go and see
Wyatt early in the next week.&#160; He added that being
expelled from a public school was not the only qualification
for success as a sheep-farmer, but that, if Mike&#8217;s
friend added to this a general intelligence and amiability,
and a skill for picking off cats with an air-pistol
and bull&#8217;s-eyes with a Lee-Enfield, there was
no reason why something should not be done for him.&#160;
In any case he would buy him a lunch, so that Wyatt
would extract at least some profit from his visit.&#160;
He said that he hoped something could be managed.&#160;
It was a pity that a boy accustomed to shoot cats
should be condemned for the rest of his life to shoot
nothing more exciting than his cuffs.</p>

<p>Wyatt&#8217;s letter was longer.&#160;
It might have been published under the title &#8220;My
First Day in a Bank, by a Beginner.&#8221;&#160; His
advent had apparently caused little sensation.&#160;
He had first had a brief conversation with the manager,
which had run as follows:&#160;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Wyatt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m ...&#160; Sportsman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cricketer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Play football?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m ...&#160; Racquets?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m ...&#160; Well, you won&#8217;t get
any more of it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>After which a Mr. Blenkinsop had led
him up to a vast ledger, in which he was to inscribe
the addresses of all out-going letters.&#160; These
letters he would then stamp, and subsequently take
in bundles to the post office.&#160; Once a week he
would be required to buy stamps.&#160; &#8220;If I
were one of those Napoleons of Finance,&#8221; wrote
Wyatt, &#8220;I should cook the accounts, I suppose,
and embezzle stamps to an incredible amount.&#160;
But it doesn&#8217;t seem in my line.&#160; I&#8217;m
afraid I wasn&#8217;t cut out for a business career.&#160;
Still, I have stamped this letter at the expense of
the office, and entered it up under the heading &#8216;Sundries,&#8217;
which is a sort of start.&#160; Look out for an article
in the <i>Wrykynian</i>, &#8217;Hints for Young Criminals,
by J. Wyatt, champion catch-as-catch-can stamp-stealer
of the British Isles.&#8217;&#160; So long.&#160; I suppose
you are playing against Ripton, now that the world
of commerce has found that it can&#8217;t get on without
me.&#160; Mind you make a century, and then perhaps
Burgess&#8217;ll give you your first after all.&#160;
There were twelve colours given three years ago, because
one chap left at half-term and the man who played
instead of him came off against Ripton.&#8221;</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>This had occurred to Mike independently.&#160;
The Ripton match was a special event, and the man
who performed any outstanding feat against that school
was treated as a sort of Horatius.&#160; Honours were
heaped upon him.&#160; If he could only make a century!
or even fifty.&#160; Even twenty, if it got the school
out of a tight place.&#160; He was as nervous on the
Saturday morning as he had been on the morning of the
M.C.C. match.&#160; It was Victory or Westminster Abbey
now.&#160; To do only averagely well, to be among the
ruck, would be as useless as not playing at all, as
far as his chance of his first was concerned.</p>

<p>It was evident to those who woke early
on the Saturday morning that this Ripton match was
not likely to end in a draw.&#160; During the Friday
rain had fallen almost incessantly in a steady drizzle.&#160;
It had stopped late at night; and at six in the morning
there was every prospect of another hot day.&#160;
There was that feeling in the air which shows that
the sun is trying to get through the clouds.&#160; The
sky was a dull grey at breakfast time, except where
a flush of deeper colour gave a hint of the sun.&#160;
It was a day on which to win the toss, and go in first.&#160;
At eleven-thirty, when the match was timed to begin,
the wicket would be too wet to be difficult.&#160;
Runs would come easily till the sun came out and began
to dry the ground.&#160; When that happened there would
be trouble for the side that was batting.</p>

<p>Burgess, inspecting the wicket with
Mr. Spence during the quarter to eleven interval,
was not slow to recognise this fact.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should win the toss to-day,
if I were you, Burgess,&#8221; said Mr. Spence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what I was thinking, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That wicket&#8217;s going to
get nasty after lunch, if the sun comes out.&#160; A
regular Rhodes wicket it&#8217;s going to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we <i>had</i> Rhodes,&#8221;
said Burgess.&#160; &#8220;Or even Wyatt.&#160; It would
just suit him, this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Spence, as a member of the staff,
was not going to be drawn into discussing Wyatt and
his premature departure, so he diverted the conversation
on to the subject of the general aspect of the school&#8217;s
attack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who will go on first with you, Burgess?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who do you think, sir?&#160; Ellerby?&#160; It
might be his wicket.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ellerby bowled medium inclining to
slow.&#160; On a pitch that suited him he was apt to
turn from leg and get people out caught at the wicket
or short slip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, Ellerby.&#160; This
end, I think.&#160; The other&#8217;s yours, though
I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll have a poor time bowling
fast to-day.&#160; Even with plenty of sawdust I doubt
if it will be possible to get a decent foothold till
after lunch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must win the toss,&#8221;
said Burgess.&#160; &#8220;It&#8217;s a nuisance too,
about our batting.&#160; Marsh will probably be dead
out of form after being in the Infirmary so long.&#160;
If he&#8217;d had a chance of getting a bit of practice
yesterday, it might have been all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That rain will have a lot to
answer for if we lose.&#160; On a dry, hard wicket
I&#8217;m certain we should beat them four times out
of six.&#160; I was talking to a man who played against
them for the Nomads.&#160; He said that on a true wicket
there was not a great deal of sting in their bowling,
but that they&#8217;ve got a slow leg-break man who
might be dangerous on a day like this.&#160; A boy
called de Freece.&#160; I don&#8217;t know of him.&#160;
He wasn&#8217;t in the team last year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know the chap.&#160; He played
wing three for them at footer against us this year
on their ground.&#160; He was crocked when they came
here.&#160; He&#8217;s a pretty useful chap all round,
I believe.&#160; Plays racquets for them too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my friend said he had
one very dangerous ball, of the Bosanquet type.&#160;
Looks as if it were going away, and comes in instead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think a lot of
that,&#8221; said Burgess ruefully.&#160; &#8220;One
consolation is, though, that that sort of ball is
easier to watch on a slow wicket.&#160; I must tell
the fellows to look out for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should.&#160; And, above all, win the toss.&#8221;</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>Burgess and Maclaine, the Ripton captain,
were old acquaintances.&#160; They had been at the
same private school, and they had played against one
another at football and cricket for two years now.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go in first, Mac,&#8221;
said Burgess, as they met on the pavilion steps after
they had changed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s awfully good of
you to suggest it,&#8221; said Maclaine. &#8220;but
I think we&#8217;ll toss.&#160; It&#8217;s a hobby
of mine.&#160; You call.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heads.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tails it is.&#160; I ought to
have warned you that you hadn&#8217;t a chance.&#160;
I&#8217;ve lost the toss five times running, so I was
bound to win to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll put us in, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;&#173;after us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, we sha&#8217;n&#8217;t
have long to wait for our knock, that&#8217;s a comfort.&#160;
Buck up and send some one in, and let&#8217;s get at
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Burgess went off to tell the ground-man
to have plenty of sawdust ready, as he would want
the field paved with it.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>The policy of the Ripton team was
obvious from the first over.&#160; They meant to force
the game.&#160; Already the sun was beginning to peep
through the haze.&#160; For about an hour run-getting
ought to be a tolerably simple process; but after
that hour singles would be as valuable as threes and
boundaries an almost unheard-of luxury.</p>

<p>So Ripton went in to hit.</p>

<p>The policy proved successful for a
time, as it generally does.&#160; Burgess, who relied
on a run that was a series of tiger-like leaps culminating
in a spring that suggested that he meant to lower the
long jump record, found himself badly handicapped
by the state of the ground.&#160; In spite of frequent
libations of sawdust, he was compelled to tread cautiously,
and this robbed his bowling of much of its pace.&#160;
The score mounted rapidly.&#160; Twenty came in ten
minutes.&#160; At thirty-five the first wicket fell,
run out.</p>

<p>At sixty Ellerby, who had found the
pitch too soft for him and had been expensive, gave
place to Grant.&#160; Grant bowled what were supposed
to be slow leg-breaks, but which did not always break.&#160;
The change worked.</p>

<p>Maclaine, after hitting the first
two balls to the boundary, skied the third to Bob
Jackson in the deep, and Bob, for whom constant practice
had robbed this sort of catch of its terrors, held
it.</p>

<p>A yorker from Burgess disposed of
the next man before he could settle down; but the
score, seventy-four for three wickets, was large enough
in view of the fact that the pitch was already becoming
more difficult, and was certain to get worse, to make
Ripton feel that the advantage was with them.&#160;
Another hour of play remained before lunch.&#160; The
deterioration of the wicket would be slow during that
period.&#160; The sun, which was now shining brightly,
would put in its deadliest work from two o&#8217;clock
onwards.&#160; Maclaine&#8217;s instructions to his
men were to go on hitting.</p>

<p>A too liberal interpretation of the
meaning of the verb &#8220;to hit&#8221; led to the
departure of two more Riptonians in the course of the
next two overs.&#160; There is a certain type of school
batsman who considers that to force the game means
to swipe blindly at every ball on the chance of taking
it half-volley.&#160; This policy sometimes leads to
a boundary or two, as it did on this occasion, but
it means that wickets will fall, as also happened
now.&#160; Seventy-four for three became eighty-six
for five.&#160; Burgess began to look happier.</p>

<p>His contentment increased when he
got the next man leg-before-wicket with the total
unaltered.&#160; At this rate Ripton would be out before
lunch for under a hundred.</p>

<p>But the rot stopped with the fall
of that wicket.&#160; Dashing tactics were laid aside.&#160;
The pitch had begun to play tricks, and the pair now
in settled down to watch the ball.&#160; They plodded
on, scoring slowly and jerkily till the hands of the
clock stood at half-past one.&#160; Then Ellerby, who
had gone on again instead of Grant, beat the less steady
of the pair with a ball that pitched on the middle
stump and shot into the base of the off.&#160; A hundred
and twenty had gone up on the board at the beginning
of the over.</p>

<p>That period which is always so dangerous,
when the wicket is bad, the ten minutes before lunch,
proved fatal to two more of the enemy.&#160; The last
man had just gone to the wickets, with the score at
a hundred and thirty-one, when a quarter to two arrived,
and with it the luncheon interval.</p>

<p>So far it was anybody&#8217;s game.</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch28">
CHAPTER XXVIII<br><br>
MIKE WINS HOME</a></h3>

<p>The Ripton last-wicket man was de
Freece, the slow bowler.&#160; He was apparently a
young gentleman wholly free from the curse of nervousness.&#160;
He wore a cheerful smile as he took guard before receiving
the first ball after lunch, and Wrykyn had plenty of
opportunity of seeing that that was his normal expression
when at the wickets.&#160; There is often a certain
looseness about the attack after lunch, and the bowler
of googlies took advantage of it now.&#160; He seemed
to be a batsman with only one hit; but he had also
a very accurate eye, and his one hit, a semicircular
stroke, which suggested the golf links rather than
the cricket field, came off with distressing frequency.&#160;
He mowed Burgess&#8217;s first ball to the square-leg
boundary, missed his second, and snicked the third
for three over long-slip&#8217;s head.&#160; The other
batsman played out the over, and de Freece proceeded
to treat Ellerby&#8217;s bowling with equal familiarity.&#160;
The scoring-board showed an increase of twenty as
the result of three overs.&#160; Every run was invaluable
now, and the Ripton contingent made the pavilion re-echo
as a fluky shot over mid-on&#8217;s head sent up the
hundred and fifty.</p>

<p>There are few things more exasperating
to the fielding side than a last-wicket stand.&#160;
It resembles in its effect the dragging-out of a book
or play after the <i>d&#233;nouement</i> has been reached.&#160;
At the fall of the ninth wicket the fieldsmen nearly
always look on their outing as finished.&#160; Just
a ball or two to the last man, and it will be their
turn to bat.&#160; If the last man insists on keeping
them out in the field, they resent it.</p>

<p>What made it especially irritating
now was the knowledge that a straight yorker would
solve the whole thing.&#160; But when Burgess bowled
a yorker, it was not straight.&#160; And when he bowled
a straight ball, it was not a yorker.&#160; A four
and a three to de Freece, and a four bye sent up a
hundred and sixty.</p>

<p>It was beginning to look as if this
might go on for ever, when Ellerby, who had been missing
the stumps by fractions of an inch, for the last ten
minutes, did what Burgess had failed to do.&#160; He
bowled a straight, medium-paced yorker, and de Freece,
swiping at it with a bright smile, found his leg-stump
knocked back.&#160; He had made twenty-eight.&#160;
His record score, he explained to Mike, as they walked
to the pavilion, for this or any ground.</p>

<p>The Ripton total was a hundred and sixty-six.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>With the ground in its usual true,
hard condition, Wrykyn would have gone in against
a score of a hundred and sixty-six with the cheery
intention of knocking off the runs for the loss of
two or three wickets.&#160; It would have been a gentle
canter for them.</p>

<p>But ordinary standards would not apply
here.&#160; On a good wicket Wrykyn that season were
a two hundred and fifty to three hundred side.&#160;
On a bad wicket&#8212;&#173;well, they had met the
Incogniti on a bad wicket, and their total&#8212;&#173;with
Wyatt playing and making top score&#8212;&#173;had worked
out at a hundred and seven.</p>

<p>A grim determination to do their best,
rather than confidence that their best, when done,
would be anything record-breaking, was the spirit
which animated the team when they opened their innings.</p>

<p>And in five minutes this had changed to a dull gloom.</p>

<p>The tragedy started with the very
first ball.&#160; It hardly seemed that the innings
had begun, when Morris was seen to leave the crease,
and make for the pavilion.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that googly man,&#8221; said Burgess
blankly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happened?&#8221;
shouted a voice from the interior of the first eleven
room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Morris is out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good gracious!&#160; How?&#8221;
asked Ellerby, emerging from the room with one pad
on his leg and the other in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;L.-b.-w.&#160; First ball.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My aunt!&#160; Who&#8217;s in next?&#160; Not
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#160; Berridge.&#160; For
goodness sake, Berry, stick a bat in the way, and
not your legs.&#160; Watch that de Freece man like a
hawk.&#160; He breaks like sin all over the shop.&#160;
Hullo, Morris!&#160; Bad luck!&#160; Were you out, do
you think?&#8221; A batsman who has been given l.-b.-w.
is always asked this question on his return to the
pavilion, and he answers it in nine cases out of ten
in the negative.&#160; Morris was the tenth case.&#160;
He thought it was all right, he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thought the thing was going to break, but it
didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear that, Berry?&#160; He doesn&#8217;t
always break.&#160; You must look out for that,&#8221;
said Burgess helpfully.&#160; Morris sat down and began
to take off his pads.</p>

<p>&#8220;That chap&#8217;ll have Berry, if he doesn&#8217;t
look out,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>But Berridge survived the ordeal.&#160;
He turned his first ball to leg for a single.</p>

<p>This brought Marsh to the batting
end; and the second tragedy occurred.</p>

<p>It was evident from the way he shaped
that Marsh was short of practice.&#160; His visit to
the Infirmary had taken the edge off his batting.&#160;
He scratched awkwardly at three balls without hitting
them.&#160; The last of the over had him in two minds.&#160;
He started to play forward, changed his stroke suddenly
and tried to step back, and the next moment the bails
had shot up like the <i>d&#233;bris</i> of a small explosion,
and the wicket-keeper was clapping his gloved hands
gently and slowly in the introspective, dreamy way
wicket-keepers have on these occasions.</p>

<p>A silence that could be felt brooded over the pavilion.</p>

<p>The voice of the scorer, addressing
from his little wooden hut the melancholy youth who
was working the telegraph-board, broke it.</p>

<p>&#8220;One for two.&#160; Last man duck.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ellerby echoed the remark.&#160; He got up, and took
off his blazer.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is all right,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;isn&#8217;t it!&#160; I wonder if the man
at the other end is a sort of young Rhodes too!&#8221;</p>

<p>Fortunately he was not.&#160; The star
of the Ripton attack was evidently de Freece.&#160;
The bowler at the other end looked fairly plain.&#160;
He sent them down medium-pace, and on a good wicket
would probably have been simple.&#160; But to-day there
was danger in the most guileless-looking deliveries.</p>

<p>Berridge relieved the tension a little
by playing safely through the over, and scoring a
couple of twos off it.&#160; And when Ellerby not only
survived the destructive de Freece&#8217;s second over,
but actually lifted a loose ball on to the roof of
the scoring-hut, the cloud began perceptibly to lift.&#160;
A no-ball in the same over sent up the first ten.&#160;
Ten for two was not good; but it was considerably better
than one for two.</p>

<p>With the score at thirty, Ellerby
was missed in the slips off de Freece.&#160; He had
been playing with slowly increasing confidence till
then, but this seemed to throw him out of his stride.&#160;
He played inside the next ball, and was all but bowled:&#160;
and then, jumping out to drive, he was smartly stumped.&#160;
The cloud began to settle again.</p>

<p>Bob was the next man in.</p>

<p>Ellerby took off his pads, and dropped
into the chair next to Mike&#8217;s.&#160; Mike was
silent and thoughtful.&#160; He was in after Bob, and
to be on the eve of batting does not make one conversational.</p>

<p>&#8220;You in next?&#8221; asked Ellerby.</p>

<p>Mike nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s getting trickier
every minute,&#8221; said Ellerby.&#160; &#8220;The
only thing is, if we can only stay in, we might have
a chance.&#160; The wicket&#8217;ll get better, and
I don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;ve any bowling at
all bar de Freece.&#160; By George, Bob&#8217;s out!...&#160;
No, he isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob had jumped out at one of de Freece&#8217;s
slows, as Ellerby had done, and had nearly met the
same fate.&#160; The wicket-keeper, however, had fumbled
the ball.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way I was
had,&#8221; said Ellerby.&#160; &#8220;That man&#8217;s
keeping such a jolly good length that you don&#8217;t
know whether to stay in your ground or go out at them.&#160;
If only somebody would knock him off his length, I
believe we might win yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>The same idea apparently occurred
to Burgess.&#160; He came to where Mike was sitting.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to shove you
down one, Jackson,&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;I shall
go in next myself and swipe, and try and knock that
man de Freece off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Mike.&#160;
He was not quite sure whether he was glad or sorry
at the respite.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pity old Wyatt
isn&#8217;t here,&#8221; said Ellerby.&#160; &#8220;This
is just the sort of time when he might have come off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bob&#8217;s broken his egg,&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good man.&#160; Every little helps....&#160;
Oh, you silly ass, get <i>back</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Berridge had called Bob for a short
run that was obviously no run.&#160; Third man was
returning the ball as the batsmen crossed.&#160; The
next moment the wicket-keeper had the bails off.&#160;
Berridge was out by a yard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forty-one for four,&#8221; said Ellerby.&#160;
&#8220;Help!&#8221;</p>

<p>Burgess began his campaign against
de Freece by skying his first ball over cover&#8217;s
head to the boundary.&#160; A howl of delight went up
from the school, which was repeated, <i>fortissimo</i>,
when, more by accident than by accurate timing, the
captain put on two more fours past extra-cover.&#160;
The bowler&#8217;s cheerful smile never varied.</p>

<p>Whether Burgess would have knocked
de Freece off his length or not was a question that
was destined to remain unsolved, for in the middle
of the other bowler&#8217;s over Bob hit a single;
the batsmen crossed; and Burgess had his leg-stump
uprooted while trying a gigantic pull-stroke.</p>

<p>The melancholy youth put up the figures,
54, 5, 12, on the board.</p>

<p>Mike, as he walked out of the pavilion
to join Bob, was not conscious of any particular nervousness.&#160;
It had been an ordeal having to wait and look on while
wickets fell, but now that the time of inaction was
at an end he felt curiously composed.&#160; When he
had gone out to bat against the M.C.C. on the occasion
of his first appearance for the school, he experienced
a quaint sensation of unreality.&#160; He seemed to
be watching his body walking to the wickets, as if
it were some one else&#8217;s.&#160; There was no sense
of individuality.</p>

<p>But now his feelings were different.&#160;
He was cool.&#160; He noticed small things&#8212;&#173;mid-off
chewing bits of grass, the bowler re-tying the scarf
round his waist, little patches of brown where the
turf had been worn away.&#160; He took guard with a
clear picture of the positions of the fieldsmen photographed
on his brain.</p>

<p>Fitness, which in a batsman exhibits
itself mainly in an increased power of seeing the
ball, is one of the most inexplicable things connected
with cricket.&#160; It has nothing, or very little,
to do with actual health.&#160; A man may come out
of a sick-room with just that extra quickness in sighting
the ball that makes all the difference; or he may
be in perfect training and play inside straight half-volleys.&#160;
Mike would not have said that he felt more than ordinarily
well that day.&#160; Indeed, he was rather painfully
conscious of having bolted his food at lunch.&#160;
But something seemed to whisper to him, as he settled
himself to face the bowler, that he was at the top
of his batting form.&#160; A difficult wicket always
brought out his latent powers as a bat.&#160; It was
a standing mystery with the sporting Press how Joe
Jackson managed to collect fifties and sixties on
wickets that completely upset men who were, apparently,
finer players.&#160; On days when the Olympians of the
cricket world were bringing their averages down with
ducks and singles, Joe would be in his element, watching
the ball and pushing it through the slips as if there
were no such thing as a tricky wicket.&#160; And Mike
took after Joe.</p>

<p>A single off the fifth ball of the
over opened his score and brought him to the opposite
end.&#160; Bob played ball number six back to the bowler,
and Mike took guard preparatory to facing de Freece.</p>

<p>The Ripton slow bowler took a long
run, considering his pace.&#160; In the early part
of an innings he often trapped the batsmen in this
way, by leading them to expect a faster ball than
he actually sent down.&#160; A queer little jump in
the middle of the run increased the difficulty of
watching him.</p>

<p>The smiting he had received from Burgess
in the previous over had not had the effect of knocking
de Freece off his length.&#160; The ball was too short
to reach with comfort, and not short enough to take
liberties with.&#160; It pitched slightly to leg, and
whipped in quickly.&#160; Mike had faced half-left,
and stepped back.&#160; The increased speed of the ball
after it had touched the ground beat him.&#160; The
ball hit his right pad.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;S that?&#8221; shouted
mid-on.&#160; Mid-on has a habit of appealing for l.-b.-w.
in school matches.</p>

<p>De Freece said nothing.&#160; The Ripton
bowler was as conscientious in the matter of appeals
as a good bowler should be.&#160; He had seen that the
ball had pitched off the leg-stump.</p>

<p>The umpire shook his head.&#160; Mid-on
tried to look as if he had not spoken.</p>

<p>Mike prepared himself for the next
ball with a glow of confidence.&#160; He felt that
he knew where he was now.&#160; Till then he had not
thought the wicket was so fast.&#160; The two balls
he had played at the other end had told him nothing.&#160;
They had been well pitched up, and he had smothered
them.&#160; He knew what to do now.&#160; He had played
on wickets of this pace at home against Saunders&#8217;s
bowling, and Saunders had shown him the right way
to cope with them.</p>

<p>The next ball was of the same length,
but this time off the off-stump.&#160; Mike jumped
out, and hit it before it had time to break.&#160; It
flew along the ground through the gap between cover
and extra-cover, a comfortable three.</p>

<p>Bob played out the over with elaborate care.</p>

<p>Off the second ball of the other man&#8217;s
over Mike scored his first boundary.&#160; It was a
long-hop on the off.&#160; He banged it behind point
to the terrace-bank.&#160; The last ball of the over,
a half-volley to leg, he lifted over the other boundary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sixty up,&#8221; said Ellerby,
in the pavilion, as the umpire signalled another no-ball.&#160;
&#8220;By George!&#160; I believe these chaps are going
to knock off the runs.&#160; Young Jackson looks as
if he was in for a century.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ass,&#8221; said Berridge.&#160;
&#8220;Don&#8217;t say that, or he&#8217;s certain
to get out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Berridge was one of those who are
skilled in cricket superstitions.</p>

<p>But Mike did not get out.&#160; He
took seven off de Freece&#8217;s next over by means
of two cuts and a drive.&#160; And, with Bob still exhibiting
a stolid and rock-like defence, the score mounted
to eighty, thence to ninety, and so, mainly by singles,
to a hundred.</p>

<p>At a hundred and four, when the wicket
had put on exactly fifty, Bob fell to a combination
of de Freece and extra-cover.&#160; He had stuck like
a limpet for an hour and a quarter, and made twenty-one.</p>

<p>Mike watched him go with much the
same feelings as those of a man who turns away from
the platform after seeing a friend off on a long railway
journey.&#160; His departure upset the scheme of things.&#160;
For himself he had no fear now.&#160; He might possibly
get out off his next ball, but he felt set enough
to stay at the wickets till nightfall.&#160; He had
had narrow escapes from de Freece, but he was full
of that conviction, which comes to all batsmen on
occasion, that this was his day.&#160; He had made
twenty-six, and the wicket was getting easier.&#160;
He could feel the sting going out of the bowling every
over.</p>

<p>Henfrey, the next man in, was a promising
rather than an effective bat.&#160; He had an excellent
style, but he was uncertain. (Two years later, when
he captained the Wrykyn teams, he made a lot of runs.)
But this season his batting had been spasmodic.</p>

<p>To-day he never looked like settling
down.&#160; He survived an over from de Freece, and
hit a fast change bowler who had been put on at the
other end for a couple of fluky fours.&#160; Then Mike
got the bowling for three consecutive overs, and raised
the score to a hundred and twenty-six.&#160; A bye
brought Henfrey to the batting end again, and de Freece&#8217;s
pet googly, which had not been much in evidence hitherto,
led to his snicking an easy catch into short-slip&#8217;s
hands.</p>

<p>A hundred and twenty-seven for seven
against a total of a hundred and sixty-six gives the
impression that the batting side has the advantage.&#160;
In the present case, however, it was Ripton who were
really in the better position.&#160; Apparently, Wrykyn
had three more wickets to fall.&#160; Practically they
had only one, for neither Ashe, nor Grant, nor Devenish
had any pretensions to be considered batsmen.&#160;
Ashe was the school wicket-keeper.&#160; Grant and
Devenish were bowlers.&#160; Between them the three
could not be relied on for a dozen in a decent match.</p>

<p>Mike watched Ashe shape with a sinking
heart.&#160; The wicket-keeper looked like a man who
feels that his hour has come.&#160; Mike could see him
licking his lips.&#160; There was nervousness written
all over him.</p>

<p>He was not kept long in suspense.&#160;
De Freece&#8217;s first ball made a hideous wreck
of his wicket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Over,&#8221; said the umpire.</p>

<p>Mike felt that the school&#8217;s
one chance now lay in his keeping the bowling.&#160;
But how was he to do this?&#160; It suddenly occurred
to him that it was a delicate position that he was
in.&#160; It was not often that he was troubled by
an inconvenient modesty, but this happened now.&#160;
Grant was a fellow he hardly knew, and a school prefect
to boot.&#160; Could he go up to him and explain that
he, Jackson, did not consider him competent to bat
in this crisis?&#160; Would not this get about and be
accounted to him for side?&#160; He had made forty,
but even so....</p>

<p>Fortunately Grant solved the problem
on his own account.&#160; He came up to Mike and spoke
with an earnestness born of nerves.&#160; &#8220;For
goodness sake,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;collar
the bowling all you know, or we&#8217;re done.&#160;
I shall get outed first ball.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Mike,
and set his teeth.&#160; Forty to win!&#160; A large
order.&#160; But it was going to be done.&#160; His whole
existence seemed to concentrate itself on those forty
runs.</p>

<p>The fast bowler, who was the last
of several changes that had been tried at the other
end, was well-meaning but erratic.&#160; The wicket
was almost true again now, and it was possible to
take liberties.</p>

<p>Mike took them.</p>

<p>A distant clapping from the pavilion,
taken up a moment later all round the ground, and
echoed by the Ripton fieldsmen, announced that he
had reached his fifty.</p>

<p>The last ball of the over he mishit.&#160;
It rolled in the direction of third man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; shouted Grant.</p>

<p>Mike and the ball arrived at the opposite
wicket almost simultaneously.&#160; Another fraction
of a second, and he would have been run out.</p>

<center><a name="illus6">
<img src="images/jmike6.jpg" alt="MIKE AND THE BALL ARRIVED ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY">
</a></center>

<p>The last balls of the next two overs
provided repetitions of this performance.&#160; But
each time luck was with him, and his bat was across
the crease before the bails were off.&#160; The telegraph-board
showed a hundred and fifty.</p>

<p>The next over was doubly sensational.&#160;
The original medium-paced bowler had gone on again
in place of the fast man, and for the first five balls
he could not find his length.&#160; During those five
balls Mike raised the score to a hundred and sixty.</p>

<p>But the sixth was of a different kind.&#160;
Faster than the rest and of a perfect length, it all
but got through Mike&#8217;s defence.&#160; As it was,
he stopped it.&#160; But he did not score.&#160; The
umpire called &#8220;Over!&#8221; and there was Grant
at the batting end, with de Freece smiling pleasantly
as he walked back to begin his run with the comfortable
reflection that at last he had got somebody except
Mike to bowl at.</p>

<p>That over was an experience Mike never forgot.</p>

<p>Grant pursued the Fabian policy of
keeping his bat almost immovable and trusting to luck.&#160;
Point and the slips crowded round.&#160; Mid-off and
mid-on moved half-way down the pitch.&#160; Grant looked
embarrassed, but determined.&#160; For four balls he
baffled the attack, though once nearly caught by point
a yard from the wicket.&#160; The fifth curled round
his bat, and touched the off-stump.&#160; A bail fell
silently to the ground.</p>

<p>Devenish came in to take the last ball of the over.</p>

<p>It was an awe-inspiring moment.&#160;
A great stillness was over all the ground.&#160; Mike&#8217;s
knees trembled.&#160; Devenish&#8217;s face was a delicate
grey.</p>

<p>The only person unmoved seemed to
be de Freece.&#160; His smile was even more amiable
than usual as he began his run.</p>

<p>The next moment the crisis was past.&#160;
The ball hit the very centre of Devenish&#8217;s bat,
and rolled back down the pitch.</p>

<p>The school broke into one great howl
of joy.&#160; There were still seven runs between them
and victory, but nobody appeared to recognise this
fact as important.&#160; Mike had got the bowling, and
the bowling was not de Freece&#8217;s.</p>

<p>It seemed almost an anti-climax when
a four to leg and two two&#8217;s through the slips
settled the thing.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>Devenish was caught and bowled in
de Freece&#8217;s next over; but the Wrykyn total
was one hundred and seventy-two.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>&#8220;Good game,&#8221; said Maclaine,
meeting Burgess in the pavilion.&#160; &#8220;Who was
the man who made all the runs?&#160; How many, by the
way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eighty-three.&#160; It was young
Jackson.&#160; Brother of the other one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That family!&#160; How many
more of them are you going to have here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the last.&#160; I
say, rough luck on de Freece.&#160; He bowled rippingly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Politeness to a beaten foe caused
Burgess to change his usual &#8220;not bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The funny part of it is,&#8221;
continued he, &#8220;that young Jackson was only playing
as a sub.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a rum idea of what&#8217;s
funny,&#8221; said Maclaine.</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch29">
CHAPTER XXIX<br><br>
WYATT AGAIN</a></h3>

<p>It was a morning in the middle of
September.&#160; The Jacksons were breakfasting.&#160;
Mr. Jackson was reading letters.&#160; The rest, including
Gladys Maud, whose finely chiselled features were gradually
disappearing behind a mask of bread-and-milk, had settled
down to serious work.&#160; The usual catch-as-catch-can
contest between Marjory and Phyllis for the jam (referee
and time-keeper, Mrs. Jackson) had resulted, after
both combatants had been cautioned by the referee,
in a victory for Marjory, who had duly secured the
stakes.&#160; The hour being nine-fifteen, and the
official time for breakfast nine o&#8217;clock, Mike&#8217;s
place was still empty.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had a letter from MacPherson,&#8221;
said Mr. Jackson.</p>

<p>MacPherson was the vigorous and persevering
gentleman, referred to in a previous chapter, who
kept a fatherly eye on the Buenos Ayres sheep.</p>

<p>&#8220;He seems very satisfied with
Mike&#8217;s friend Wyatt.&#160; At the moment of writing
Wyatt is apparently incapacitated owing to a bullet
in the shoulder, but expects to be fit again shortly.&#160;
That young man seems to make things fairly lively
wherever he is.&#160; I don&#8217;t wonder he found
a public school too restricted a sphere for his energies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has he been fighting a duel?&#8221;
asked Marjory, interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bushrangers,&#8221; said Phyllis.</p>

<p>&#8220;There aren&#8217;t any bushrangers in Buenos
Ayres,&#8221; said Ella.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; said Phyllis clinchingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bush-ray, bush-ray, bush-ray,&#8221;
began Gladys Maud, conversationally, through the bread-and-milk;
but was headed off.</p>

<p>&#8220;He gives no details.&#160; Perhaps
that letter on Mike&#8217;s plate supplies them.&#160;
I see it comes from Buenos Ayres.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish Mike would come and
open it,&#8221; said Marjory.&#160; &#8220;Shall I go
and hurry him up?&#8221;</p>

<p>The missing member of the family entered as she spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Buck up, Mike,&#8221; she shouted.&#160;
&#8220;There&#8217;s a letter from Wyatt.&#160; He&#8217;s
been wounded in a duel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With a bushranger,&#8221; added Phyllis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bush-ray,&#8221; explained Gladys Maud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there?&#8221; said Mike.&#160; &#8220;Sorry
I&#8217;m late.&#8221;</p>

<p>He opened the letter and began to read.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does he say?&#8221; inquired Marjory.&#160;
&#8220;Who was the duel with?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many bushrangers were there?&#8221; asked
Phyllis.</p>

<p>Mike read on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good old Wyatt!&#160; He&#8217;s shot a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Killed him?&#8221; asked Marjory excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#160; Only potted him in
the leg.&#160; This is what he says.&#160; First page
is mostly about the Ripton match and so on.&#160; Here
you are.&#160; &#8217;I&#8217;m dictating this to a
sportsman of the name of Danvers, a good chap who can&#8217;t
help being ugly, so excuse bad writing.&#160; The fact
is we&#8217;ve been having a bust-up here, and I&#8217;ve
come out of it with a bullet in the shoulder, which
has crocked me for the time being.&#160; It happened
like this.&#160; An ass of a Gaucho had gone into the
town and got jolly tight, and coming back, he wanted
to ride through our place.&#160; The old woman who
keeps the lodge wouldn&#8217;t have it at any price.&#160;
Gave him the absolute miss-in-baulk.&#160; So this
rotter, instead of shifting off, proceeded to cut
the fence, and go through that way.&#160; All the farms
out here have their boundaries marked by wire fences,
and it is supposed to be a deadly sin to cut these.&#160;
Well, the lodge-keeper&#8217;s son dashed off in search
of help.&#160; A chap called Chester, an Old Wykehamist,
and I were dipping sheep close by, so he came to us
and told us what had happened.&#160; We nipped on to
a couple of horses, pulled out our revolvers, and
tooled after him.&#160; After a bit we overtook him,
and that&#8217;s when the trouble began.&#160; The
johnny had dismounted when we arrived.&#160; I thought
he was simply tightening his horse&#8217;s girths.&#160;
What he was really doing was getting a steady aim
at us with his revolver.&#160; He fired as we came
up, and dropped poor old Chester.&#160; I thought he
was killed at first, but it turned out it was only
his leg.&#160; I got going then.&#160; I emptied all
the six chambers of my revolver, and missed him clean
every time.&#160; In the meantime he got me in the
right shoulder.&#160; Hurt like sin afterwards, though
it was only a sort of dull shock at the moment.&#160;
The next item of the programme was a forward move
in force on the part of the enemy.&#160; The man had
got his knife out now&#8212;&#173;why he didn&#8217;t
shoot again I don&#8217;t know&#8212;&#173;and toddled
over in our direction to finish us off.&#160; Chester
was unconscious, and it was any money on the Gaucho,
when I happened to catch sight of Chester&#8217;s
pistol, which had fallen just by where I came down.&#160;
I picked it up, and loosed off.&#160; Missed the first
shot, but got him with the second in the ankle at
about two yards; and his day&#8217;s work was done.&#160;
That&#8217;s the painful story.&#160; Danvers says he&#8217;s
getting writer&#8217;s cramp, so I shall have to stop....&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a dreadful thing!&#8221; said Mrs. Jackson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow, it was practically a bushranger,&#8221;
said Phyllis.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you it was a duel, and so it was,&#8221;
said Marjory.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a terrible experience for the poor boy!&#8221;
said Mrs. Jackson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Much better than being in a
beastly bank,&#8221; said Mike, summing up.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m
glad he&#8217;s having such a ripping time.&#160; It
must be almost as decent as Wrykyn out there....&#160;
I say, what&#8217;s under that dish?&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch30">
CHAPTER XXX<br><br>
MR. JACKSON MAKES UP HIS MIND</a></h3>

<p>Two years have elapsed and Mike is home again for
the Easter holidays.</p>

<p>If Mike had been in time for breakfast
that morning he might have gathered from the expression
on his father&#8217;s face, as Mr. Jackson opened
the envelope containing his school report and read
the contents, that the document in question was not
exactly a paean of praise from beginning to end.&#160;
But he was late, as usual.&#160; Mike always was late
for breakfast in the holidays.</p>

<p>When he came down on this particular
morning, the meal was nearly over.&#160; Mr. Jackson
had disappeared, taking his correspondence with him;
Mrs. Jackson had gone into the kitchen, and when Mike
appeared the thing had resolved itself into a mere
vulgar brawl between Phyllis and Ella for the jam,
while Marjory, who had put her hair up a fortnight
before, looked on in a detached sort of way, as if
these juvenile gambols distressed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, Mike,&#8221; she said,
jumping up as he entered; &#8220;here you are&#8212;&#173;I&#8217;ve
been keeping everything hot for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you?&#160; Thanks awfully.&#160;
I say&#8212;&#173;&#8221; his eye wandered in mild surprise
round the table.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m a bit late.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marjory was bustling about, fetching
and carrying for Mike, as she always did.&#160; She
had adopted him at an early age, and did the thing
thoroughly.&#160; She was fond of her other brothers,
especially when they made centuries in first-class
cricket, but Mike was her favourite.&#160; She would
field out in the deep as a natural thing when Mike
was batting at the net in the paddock, though for
the others, even for Joe, who had played in all five
Test Matches in the previous summer, she would do
it only as a favour.</p>

<p>Phyllis and Ella finished their dispute
and went out.&#160; Marjory sat on the table and watched
Mike eat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your report came this morning, Mike,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>The kidneys failed to retain Mike&#8217;s
undivided attention.&#160; He looked up interested.&#160;
&#8220;What did it say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see&#8212;&#173;I
only caught sight of the Wrykyn crest on the envelope.&#160;
Father didn&#8217;t say anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike seemed concerned.&#160; &#8220;I
say, that looks rather rotten!&#160; I wonder if it
was awfully bad.&#160; It&#8217;s the first I&#8217;ve
had from Appleby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be any worse
than the horrid ones Mr. Blake used to write when
you were in his form.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s a comfort,&#8221;
said Mike philosophically.&#160; &#8220;Think there&#8217;s
any more tea in that pot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I call it a shame,&#8221; said
Marjory; &#8220;they ought to be jolly glad to have
you at Wrykyn just for cricket, instead of writing
beastly reports that make father angry and don&#8217;t
do any good to anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Last summer he said he&#8217;d
take me away if I got another one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t mean it really,
I <i>know</i> he didn&#8217;t!&#160; He couldn&#8217;t!&#160;
You&#8217;re the best bat Wrykyn&#8217;s ever had.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What ho!&#8221; interpolated Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>are</i>.&#160; Everybody
says you are.&#160; Why, you got your first the very
first term you were there&#8212;&#173;even Joe didn&#8217;t
do anything nearly so good as that.&#160; Saunders
says you&#8217;re simply bound to play for England
in another year or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Saunders is a jolly good chap.&#160;
He bowled me a half-volley on the off the first ball
I had in a school match.&#160; By the way, I wonder
if he&#8217;s out at the net now.&#160; Let&#8217;s
go and see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saunders was setting up the net when
they arrived.&#160; Mike put on his pads and went to
the wickets, while Marjory and the dogs retired as
usual to the far hedge to retrieve.</p>

<p>She was kept busy.&#160; Saunders was
a good sound bowler of the M.C.C. minor match type,
and there had been a time when he had worried Mike
considerably, but Mike had been in the Wrykyn team
for three seasons now, and each season he had advanced
tremendously in his batting.&#160; He had filled out
in three years.&#160; He had always had the style, and
now he had the strength as well.&#160; Saunders&#8217;s
bowling on a true wicket seemed simple to him.&#160;
It was early in the Easter holidays, but already he
was beginning to find his form.&#160; Saunders, who
looked on Mike as his own special invention, was delighted.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t be worried
by being too anxious now that you&#8217;re captain,
Master Mike,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you&#8217;ll make
a century every match next term.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I wasn&#8217;t; it&#8217;s a beastly
responsibility.&#8221;</p>

<p>Henfrey, the Wrykyn cricket captain
of the previous season, was not returning next term,
and Mike was to reign in his stead.&#160; He liked the
prospect, but it certainly carried with it a rather
awe-inspiring responsibility.&#160; At night sometimes
he would lie awake, appalled by the fear of losing
his form, or making a hash of things by choosing the
wrong men to play for the school and leaving the right
men out.&#160; It is no light thing to captain a public
school at cricket.</p>

<p>As he was walking towards the house,
Phyllis met him.&#160; &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve been hunting
for you, Mike; father wants you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s in the study.&#160;
He seems&#8212;&#173;&#8221; added Phyllis, throwing
in the information by way of a make-weight, &#8220;in
a beastly wax.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike&#8217;s jaw fell slightly.&#160;
&#8220;I hope the dickens it&#8217;s nothing to do
with that bally report,&#8221; was his muttered exclamation.</p>

<p>Mike&#8217;s dealings with his father
were as a rule of a most pleasant nature.&#160; Mr.
Jackson was an understanding sort of man, who treated
his sons as companions.&#160; From time to time, however,
breezes were apt to ruffle the placid sea of good-fellowship.&#160;
Mike&#8217;s end-of-term report was an unfailing wind-raiser;
indeed, on the arrival of Mr. Blake&#8217;s sarcastic
<i>r&#233;sum&#233;</i> of Mike&#8217;s short-comings at the
end of the previous term, there had been something
not unlike a typhoon.&#160; It was on this occasion
that Mr. Jackson had solemnly declared his intention
of removing Mike from Wrykyn unless the critics became
more flattering; and Mr. Jackson was a man of his
word.</p>

<p>It was with a certain amount of apprehension,
therefore, that Jackson entered the study.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in, Mike,&#8221; said
his father, kicking the waste-paper basket; &#8220;I
want to speak to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike, skilled in omens, scented a
row in the offing.&#160; Only in moments of emotion
was Mr. Jackson in the habit of booting the basket.</p>

<p>There followed an awkward silence,
which Mike broke by remarking that he had carted a
half-volley from Saunders over the on-side hedge that
morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was just a bit short and
off the leg stump, so I stepped out&#8212;&#173;may
I bag the paper-knife for a jiffy?&#160; I&#8217;ll
just show&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind about cricket now,&#8221;
said Mr. Jackson; &#8220;I want you to listen to this
report.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, is that my report, father?&#8221;
said Mike, with a sort of sickly interest, much as
a dog about to be washed might evince in his tub.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; replied Mr. Jackson
in measured tones, &#8220;your report; what is more,
it is without exception the worst report you have ever
had.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I say!&#8221; groaned the record-breaker.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;His conduct,&#8217;&#8221;
quoted Mr. Jackson, &#8220;&#8217;has been unsatisfactory
in the extreme, both in and out of school.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t anything really.&#160; I only
happened&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>Remembering suddenly that what he
had happened to do was to drop a cannon-ball (the
school weight) on the form-room floor, not once, but
on several occasions, he paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;French bad; conduct disgraceful&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everybody rags in French.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mathematics bad.&#160; Inattentive and
idle.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody does much work in Math.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Latin poor.&#160; Greek, very poor.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were doing Thucydides, Book
Two, last term&#8212;&#173;all speeches and doubtful
readings, and cruxes and things&#8212;&#173;beastly
hard!&#160; Everybody says so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here are Mr. Appleby&#8217;s
remarks:&#160; &#8217;The boy has genuine ability, which
he declines to use in the smallest degree.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike moaned a moan of righteous indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;An abnormal proficiency
at games has apparently destroyed all desire in him
to realise the more serious issues of life.&#8217;&#160;
There is more to the same effect.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Appleby was a master with very
definite ideas as to what constituted a public-school
master&#8217;s duties.&#160; As a man he was distinctly
pro-Mike.&#160; He understood cricket, and some of Mike&#8217;s
shots on the off gave him thrills of pure aesthetic
joy; but as a master he always made it his habit to
regard the manners and customs of the boys in his
form with an unbiased eye, and to an unbiased eye Mike
in a form-room was about as near the extreme edge
as a boy could be, and Mr. Appleby said as much in
a clear firm hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You remember what I said to
you about your report at Christmas, Mike?&#8221; said
Mr. Jackson, folding the lethal document and replacing
it in its envelope.</p>

<p>Mike said nothing; there was a sinking
feeling in his interior.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall abide by what I said.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike&#8217;s heart thumped.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not go back to Wrykyn next term.&#8221;</p>

<p>Somewhere in the world the sun was
shining, birds were twittering; somewhere in the world
lambkins frisked and peasants sang blithely at their
toil (flat, perhaps, but still blithely), but to Mike
at that moment the sky was black, and an icy wind
blew over the face of the earth.</p>

<p>The tragedy had happened, and there
was an end of it.&#160; He made no attempt to appeal
against the sentence.&#160; He knew it would be useless,
his father, when he made up his mind, having all the
unbending tenacity of the normally easy-going man.</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson was sorry for Mike.&#160;
He understood him, and for that reason he said very
little now.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sending you to Sedleigh,&#8221; was his
next remark.</p>

<p>Sedleigh!&#160; Mike sat up with a
jerk.&#160; He knew Sedleigh by name&#8212;&#173;one
of those schools with about a hundred fellows which
you never hear of except when they send up their gymnasium
pair to Aldershot, or their Eight to Bisley.&#160;
Mike&#8217;s outlook on life was that of a cricketer,
pure and simple.&#160; What had Sedleigh ever done?&#160;
What were they ever likely to do?&#160; Whom did they
play?&#160; What Old Sedleighan had ever done anything
at cricket?&#160; Perhaps they didn&#8217;t even <i>play</i>
cricket!</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s an awful hole,&#8221; he said
blankly.</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson could read Mike&#8217;s
mind like a book.&#160; Mike&#8217;s point of view
was plain to him.&#160; He did not approve of it, but
he knew that in Mike&#8217;s place and at Mike&#8217;s
age he would have felt the same.&#160; He spoke drily
to hide his sympathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not a large school,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;and I don&#8217;t suppose it could
play Wrykyn at cricket, but it has one merit&#8212;&#173;boys
work there.&#160; Young Barlitt won a Balliol scholarship
from Sedleigh last year.&#8221;&#160; Barlitt was the
vicar&#8217;s son, a silent, spectacled youth who did
not enter very largely into Mike&#8217;s world.&#160;
They had met occasionally at tennis-parties, but not
much conversation had ensued.&#160; Barlitt&#8217;s
mind was massive, but his topics of conversation were
not Mike&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Barlitt speaks very highly
of Sedleigh,&#8221; added Mr. Jackson.</p>

<p>Mike said nothing, which was a good
deal better than saying what he would have liked to
have said.</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch31">
CHAPTER XXXI<br><br>
SEDLEIGH</a></h3>

<p>The train, which had been stopping
everywhere for the last half-hour, pulled up again,
and Mike, seeing the name of the station, got up,
opened the door, and hurled a Gladstone bag out on
to the platform in an emphatic and vindictive manner.&#160;
Then he got out himself and looked about him.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the school, sir?&#8221;
inquired the solitary porter, bustling up, as if he
hoped by sheer energy to deceive the traveller into
thinking that Sedleigh station was staffed by a great
army of porters.</p>

<p>Mike nodded.&#160; A sombre nod.&#160;
The nod Napoleon might have given if somebody had
met him in 1812, and said, &#8220;So you&#8217;re back
from Moscow, eh?&#8221; Mike was feeling thoroughly
jaundiced.&#160; The future seemed wholly gloomy.&#160;
And, so far from attempting to make the best of things,
he had set himself deliberately to look on the dark
side.&#160; He thought, for instance, that he had never
seen a more repulsive porter, or one more obviously
incompetent than the man who had attached himself with
a firm grasp to the handle of the bag as he strode
off in the direction of the luggage-van.&#160; He disliked
his voice, his appearance, and the colour of his hair.&#160;
Also the boots he wore.&#160; He hated the station,
and the man who took his ticket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Young gents at the school,
sir,&#8221; said the porter, perceiving from Mike&#8217;s
<i>distrait</i> air that the boy was a stranger to
the place, &#8220;goes up in the &#8217;bus mostly.&#160;
It&#8217;s waiting here, sir.&#160; Hi, George!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll walk, thanks,&#8221; said Mike frigidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a goodish step, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir.&#160; I&#8217;ll
send up your luggage by the &#8217;bus, sir.&#160; Which
&#8217;ouse was it you was going to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Outwood&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right, sir.&#160; It&#8217;s
straight on up this road to the school.&#160; You can&#8217;t
miss it, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Worse luck,&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>He walked off up the road, sorrier
for himself than ever.&#160; It was such absolutely
rotten luck.&#160; About now, instead of being on his
way to a place where they probably ran a diabolo team
instead of a cricket eleven, and played hunt-the-slipper
in winter, he would be on the point of arriving at
Wrykyn.&#160; And as captain of cricket, at that.&#160;
Which was the bitter part of it.&#160; He had never
been in command.&#160; For the last two seasons he
had been the star man, going in first, and heading
the averages easily at the end of the season; and
the three captains under whom he had played during
his career as a Wrykynian, Burgess, Enderby, and Henfrey
had always been sportsmen to him.&#160; But it was not
the same thing.&#160; He had meant to do such a lot
for Wrykyn cricket this term.&#160; He had had an entirely
new system of coaching in his mind.&#160; Now it might
never be used.&#160; He had handed it on in a letter
to Strachan, who would be captain in his place; but
probably Strachan would have some scheme of his own.&#160;
There is nobody who could not edit a paper in the ideal
way; and there is nobody who has not a theory of his
own about cricket-coaching at school.</p>

<p>Wrykyn, too, would be weak this year,
now that he was no longer there.&#160; Strachan was
a good, free bat on his day, and, if he survived a
few overs, might make a century in an hour, but he
was not to be depended upon.&#160; There was no doubt
that Mike&#8217;s sudden withdrawal meant that Wrykyn
would have a bad time that season.&#160; And it had
been such a wretched athletic year for the school.&#160;
The football fifteen had been hopeless, and had lost
both the Ripton matches, the return by over sixty
points.&#160; Sheen&#8217;s victory in the light-weights
at Aldershot had been their one success.&#160; And
now, on top of all this, the captain of cricket was
removed during the Easter holidays.&#160; Mike&#8217;s
heart bled for Wrykyn, and he found himself loathing
Sedleigh and all its works with a great loathing.</p>

<p>The only thing he could find in its
favour was the fact that it was set in a very pretty
country.&#160; Of a different type from the Wrykyn
country, but almost as good.&#160; For three miles Mike
made his way through woods and past fields.&#160; Once
he crossed a river.&#160; It was soon after this that
he caught sight, from the top of a hill, of a group
of buildings that wore an unmistakably school-like
look.</p>

<p>This must be Sedleigh.</p>

<p>Ten minutes&#8217; walk brought him
to the school gates, and a baker&#8217;s boy directed
him to Mr. Outwood&#8217;s.</p>

<p>There were three houses in a row,
separated from the school buildings by a cricket-field.&#160;
Outwood&#8217;s was the middle one of these.</p>

<p>Mike went to the front door, and knocked.&#160;
At Wrykyn he had always charged in at the beginning
of term at the boys&#8217; entrance, but this formal
reporting of himself at Sedleigh suited his mood.</p>

<p>He inquired for Mr. Outwood, and was
shown into a room lined with books.&#160; Presently
the door opened, and the house-master appeared.</p>

<p>There was something pleasant and homely
about Mr. Outwood.&#160; In appearance he reminded
Mike of Smee in &#8220;Peter Pan.&#8221;&#160; He had
the same eyebrows and pince-nez and the same motherly
look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jackson?&#8221; he said mildly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very glad to see you,
very glad indeed.&#160; Perhaps you would like a cup
of tea after your journey.&#160; I think you might like
a cup of tea.&#160; You come from Crofton, in Shropshire,
I understand, Jackson, near Brindleford?&#160; It is
a part of the country which I have always wished to
visit.&#160; I daresay you have frequently seen the
Cluniac Priory of St. Ambrose at Brindleford?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike, who would not have recognised
a Cluniac Priory if you had handed him one on a tray,
said he had not.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#160; You have missed
an opportunity which I should have been glad to have.&#160;
I am preparing a book on Ruined Abbeys and Priories
of England, and it has always been my wish to see
the Cluniac Priory of St. Ambrose.&#160; A deeply interesting
relic of the sixteenth century.&#160; Bishop Geoffrey,
1133-40&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I go across to the boys&#8217; part,
sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#160; Yes.&#160; Oh, yes.&#160;
Quite so.&#160; And perhaps you would like a cup of
tea after your journey?&#160; No?&#160; Quite so.&#160;
Quite so.&#160; You should make a point of visiting
the remains of the Cluniac Priory in the summer holidays,
Jackson.&#160; You will find the matron in her room.&#160;
In many respects it is unique.&#160; The northern altar
is in a state of really wonderful preservation.&#160;
It consists of a solid block of masonry five feet long
and two and a half wide, with chamfered plinth, standing
quite free from the apse wall.&#160; It will well repay
a visit.&#160; Good-bye for the present, Jackson, good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike wandered across to the other
side of the house, his gloom visibly deepened.&#160;
All alone in a strange school, where they probably
played hopscotch, with a house-master who offered
one cups of tea after one&#8217;s journey and talked
about chamfered plinths and apses.&#160; It was a little
hard.</p>

<p>He strayed about, finding his bearings,
and finally came to a room which he took to be the
equivalent of the senior day-room at a Wrykyn house.&#160;
Everywhere else he had found nothing but emptiness.&#160;
Evidently he had come by an earlier train than was
usual.&#160; But this room was occupied.</p>

<p>A very long, thin youth, with a solemn
face and immaculate clothes, was leaning against the
mantelpiece.&#160; As Mike entered, he fumbled in his
top left waistcoat pocket, produced an eyeglass attached
to a cord, and fixed it in his right eye.&#160; With
the help of this aid to vision he inspected Mike in
silence for a while, then, having flicked an invisible
speck of dust from the left sleeve of his coat, he
spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>He spoke in a tired voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo,&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take a seat,&#8221; said the
immaculate one.&#160; &#8220;If you don&#8217;t mind
dirtying your bags, that&#8217;s to say.&#160; Personally,
I don&#8217;t see any prospect of ever sitting down
in this place.&#160; It looks to me as if they meant
to use these chairs as mustard-and-cress beds.&#160;
A Nursery Garden in the Home.&#160; That sort of idea.&#160;
My name,&#8221; he added pensively, &#8220;is Smith.&#160;
What&#8217;s yours?&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch32">
CHAPTER XXXII<br><br>
PSMITH</a></h3>

<p>&#8220;Jackson,&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you the Bully, the Pride
of the School, or the Boy who is Led Astray and takes
to Drink in Chapter Sixteen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The last, for choice,&#8221;
said Mike, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve only just arrived,
so I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The boy&#8212;&#173;what will
he become?&#160; Are you new here, too, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#160; Why, are you new?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I look as if I belonged
here?&#160; I&#8217;m the latest import.&#160; Sit down
on yonder settee, and I will tell you the painful story
of my life.&#160; By the way, before I start, there&#8217;s
just one thing.&#160; If you ever have occasion to
write to me, would you mind sticking a P at the beginning
of my name?&#160; P-s-m-i-t-h.&#160; See?&#160; There
are too many Smiths, and I don&#8217;t care for Smythe.&#160;
My father&#8217;s content to worry along in the old-fashioned
way, but I&#8217;ve decided to strike out a fresh line.&#160;
I shall found a new dynasty.&#160; The resolve came
to me unexpectedly this morning, as I was buying a
simple penn&#8217;orth of butterscotch out of the
automatic machine at Paddington.&#160; I jotted it down
on the back of an envelope.&#160; In conversation you
may address me as Rupert (though I hope you won&#8217;t),
or simply Smith, the P not being sounded.&#160; Cp.
the name Zbysco, in which the Z is given a similar
miss-in-baulk.&#160; See?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike said he saw.&#160; Psmith thanked
him with a certain stately old-world courtesy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us start at the beginning,&#8221;
he resumed.&#160; &#8220;My infancy.&#160; When I was
but a babe, my eldest sister was bribed with a shilling
an hour by my nurse to keep an eye on me, and see
that I did not raise Cain.&#160; At the end of the
first day she struck for one-and six, and got it.&#160;
We now pass to my boyhood.&#160; At an early age, I
was sent to Eton, everybody predicting a bright career
for me.&#160; But,&#8221; said Psmith solemnly, fixing
an owl-like gaze on Mike through the eye-glass, &#8220;it
was not to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#160; I was superannuated last term.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bad luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For Eton, yes.&#160; But what Eton loses, Sedleigh
gains.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why Sedleigh, of all places?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the most painful part
of my narrative.&#160; It seems that a certain scug
in the next village to ours happened last year to collar
a Balliol&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not Barlitt!&#8221; exclaimed Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was the man.&#160; The
son of the vicar.&#160; The vicar told the curate,
who told our curate, who told our vicar, who told my
father, who sent me off here to get a Balliol too.&#160;
Do <i>you</i> know Barlitt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His pater&#8217;s vicar of
our village.&#160; It was because his son got a Balliol
that I was sent here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you come from Crofton?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve lived at Lower Benford
all my life.&#160; We are practically long-lost brothers.&#160;
Cheer a little, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike felt as Robinson Crusoe felt
when he met Friday.&#160; Here was a fellow human being
in this desert place.&#160; He could almost have embraced
Psmith.&#160; The very sound of the name Lower Benford
was heartening.&#160; His dislike for his new school
was not diminished, but now he felt that life there
might at least be tolerable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where were you before you came
here?&#8221; asked Psmith.&#160; &#8220;You have heard
my painful story.&#160; Now tell me yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wrykyn.&#160; My pater took
me away because I got such a lot of bad reports.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My reports from Eton were simply
scurrilous.&#160; There&#8217;s a libel action in every
sentence.&#160; How do you like this place from what
you&#8217;ve seen of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rotten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am with you, Comrade Jackson.&#160;
You won&#8217;t mind my calling you Comrade, will
you?&#160; I&#8217;ve just become a Socialist.&#160;
It&#8217;s a great scheme.&#160; You ought to be one.&#160;
You work for the equal distribution of property, and
start by collaring all you can and sitting on it.&#160;
We must stick together.&#160; We are companions in
misfortune.&#160; Lost lambs.&#160; Sheep that have
gone astray.&#160; Divided, we fall, together we may
worry through.&#160; Have you seen Professor Radium
yet?&#160; I should say Mr. Outwood.&#160; What do you
think of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t seem a bad
sort of chap.&#160; Bit off his nut.&#160; Jawed about
apses and things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And thereby,&#8221; said Psmith,
&#8220;hangs a tale.&#160; I&#8217;ve been making inquiries
of a stout sportsman in a sort of Salvation Army uniform,
whom I met in the grounds&#8212;&#173;he&#8217;s the
school sergeant or something, quite a solid man&#8212;&#173;and
I hear that Comrade Outwood&#8217;s an archaeological
cove.&#160; Goes about the country beating up old ruins
and fossils and things.&#160; There&#8217;s an Archaeological
Society in the school, run by him.&#160; It goes out
on half-holidays, prowling about, and is allowed to
break bounds and generally steep itself to the eyebrows
in reckless devilry.&#160; And, mark you, laddie, if
you belong to the Archaeological Society you get off
cricket.&#160; To get off cricket,&#8221; said Psmith,
dusting his right trouser-leg, &#8220;was the dream
of my youth and the aspiration of my riper years.&#160;
A noble game, but a bit too thick for me.&#160; At Eton
I used to have to field out at the nets till the soles
of my boots wore through.&#160; I suppose you are a
blood at the game?&#160; Play for the school against
Loamshire, and so on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to play here, at any rate,&#8221;
said Mike.</p>

<p>He had made up his mind on this point
in the train.&#160; There is a certain fascination
about making the very worst of a bad job.&#160; Achilles
knew his business when he sat in his tent.&#160; The
determination not to play cricket for Sedleigh as
he could not play for Wrykyn gave Mike a sort of pleasure.&#160;
To stand by with folded arms and a sombre frown, as
it were, was one way of treating the situation, and
one not without its meed of comfort.</p>

<p>Psmith approved the resolve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stout fellow,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;&#8217;Tis well.&#160; You and I, hand in hand,
will search the countryside for ruined abbeys.&#160;
We will snare the elusive fossil together.&#160; Above
all, we will go out of bounds.&#160; We shall thus
improve our minds, and have a jolly good time as well.&#160;
I shouldn&#8217;t wonder if one mightn&#8217;t borrow
a gun from some friendly native, and do a bit of rabbit-shooting
here and there.&#160; From what I saw of Comrade Outwood
during our brief interview, I shouldn&#8217;t think
he was one of the lynx-eyed contingent.&#160; With
tact we ought to be able to slip away from the merry
throng of fossil-chasers, and do a bit on our own
account.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good idea,&#8221; said Mike.&#160;
&#8220;We will.&#160; A chap at Wrykyn, called Wyatt,
used to break out at night and shoot at cats with
an air-pistol.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would take a lot to make
me do that.&#160; I am all against anything that interferes
with my sleep.&#160; But rabbits in the daytime is a
scheme.&#160; We&#8217;ll nose about for a gun at the
earliest opp.&#160; Meanwhile we&#8217;d better go
up to Comrade Outwood, and get our names shoved down
for the Society.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I vote we get some tea first somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s beat up a
study.&#160; I suppose they have studies here.&#160;
Let&#8217;s go and look.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went upstairs.&#160; On the first
floor there was a passage with doors on either side.&#160;
Psmith opened the first of these.</p>

<p>&#8220;This&#8217;ll do us well,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>It was a biggish room, looking out
over the school grounds.&#160; There were a couple
of deal tables, two empty bookcases, and a looking-glass,
hung on a nail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Might have been made for us,&#8221; said Psmith
approvingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it belongs to some rotter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t going to collar it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said Psmith, looking
at himself earnestly in the mirror, and straightening
his tie, &#8220;is the exact programme.&#160; We must
stake out our claims.&#160; This is practical Socialism.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the real owner&#8217;s bound to turn up
some time or other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His misfortune, not ours.&#160;
You can&#8217;t expect two master-minds like us to
pig it in that room downstairs.&#160; There are moments
when one wants to be alone.&#160; It is imperative
that we have a place to retire to after a fatiguing
day.&#160; And now, if you want to be really useful,
come and help me fetch up my box from downstairs.&#160;
It&#8217;s got an Etna and various things in it.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch33">
CHAPTER XXXIII<br><br>
STAKING OUT A CLAIM</a></h3>

<p>Psmith, in the matter of decorating
a study and preparing tea in it, was rather a critic
than an executant.&#160; He was full of ideas, but he
preferred to allow Mike to carry them out.&#160; It
was he who suggested that the wooden bar which ran
across the window was unnecessary, but it was Mike
who wrenched it from its place.&#160; Similarly, it
was Mike who abstracted the key from the door of the
next study, though the idea was Psmith&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Privacy,&#8221; said Psmith,
as he watched Mike light the Etna, &#8220;is what we
chiefly need in this age of publicity.&#160; If you
leave a study door unlocked in these strenuous times,
the first thing you know is, somebody comes right
in, sits down, and begins to talk about himself.&#160;
I think with a little care we ought to be able to make
this room quite decently comfortable.&#160; That putrid
calendar must come down, though.&#160; Do you think
you could make a long arm, and haul it off the parent
tin-tack?&#160; Thanks.&#160; We make progress.&#160;
We make progress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall jolly well make it
out of the window,&#8221; said Mike, spooning up tea
from a paper bag with a postcard, &#8220;if a sort
of young Hackenschmidt turns up and claims the study.&#160;
What are you going to do about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let us worry about
it.&#160; I have a presentiment that he will be an
insignificant-looking little weed.&#160; How are you
getting on with the evening meal?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just ready.&#160; What would
you give to be at Eton now?&#160; I&#8217;d give something
to be at Wrykyn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These school reports,&#8221;
said Psmith sympathetically, &#8220;are the very dickens.&#160;
Many a bright young lad has been soured by them.&#160;
Hullo.&#160; What&#8217;s this, I wonder.&#8221;</p>

<p>A heavy body had plunged against the
door, evidently without a suspicion that there would
be any resistance.&#160; A rattling at the handle followed,
and a voice outside said, &#8220;Dash the door!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hackenschmidt!&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;The weed,&#8221; said Psmith.&#160;
&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t make a long arm, could you,
and turn the key?&#160; We had better give this merchant
audience.&#160; Remind me later to go on with my remarks
on school reports.&#160; I had several bright things
to say on the subject.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike unlocked the door, and flung
it open.&#160; Framed in the entrance was a smallish,
freckled boy, wearing a bowler hat and carrying a bag.&#160;
On his face was an expression of mingled wrath and
astonishment.</p>

<p>Psmith rose courteously from his chair,
and moved forward with slow stateliness to do the
honours.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the dickens,&#8221; inquired
the newcomer, &#8220;are you doing here?&#8221;</p>

<center><a name="illus7">
<img src="images/jmike7.jpg" alt="&#8220;WHAT THE DICKENS ARE YOU DOING HERE?&#8221;">
</a></center>

<p>&#8220;We were having a little tea,&#8221;
said Psmith, &#8220;to restore our tissues after our
journey.&#160; Come in and join us.&#160; We keep open
house, we Psmiths.&#160; Let me introduce you to Comrade
Jackson.&#160; A stout fellow.&#160; Homely in appearance,
perhaps, but one of us.&#160; I am Psmith.&#160; Your
own name will doubtless come up in the course of general
chit-chat over the tea-cups.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name&#8217;s Spiller, and this is my study.&#8221;</p>

<p>Psmith leaned against the mantelpiece,
put up his eyeglass, and harangued Spiller in a philosophical
vein.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of all sad words of tongue
or pen,&#8221; said he, &#8220;the saddest are these:&#160;
&#8216;It might have been.&#8217;&#160; Too late!&#160;
That is the bitter cry.&#160; If you had torn yourself
from the bosom of the Spiller family by an earlier
train, all might have been well.&#160; But no.&#160;
Your father held your hand and said huskily, &#8216;Edwin,
don&#8217;t leave us!&#8217; Your mother clung to you
weeping, and said, &#8216;Edwin, stay!&#8217; Your
sisters&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to know what&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your sisters froze on to your
knees like little octopuses (or octopi), and screamed,
&#8216;Don&#8217;t go, Edwin!&#8217; And so,&#8221;
said Psmith, deeply affected by his recital, &#8220;you
stayed on till the later train; and, on arrival, you
find strange faces in the familiar room, a people that
know not Spiller.&#8221;&#160; Psmith went to the table,
and cheered himself with a sip of tea.&#160; Spiller&#8217;s
sad case had moved him greatly.</p>

<p>The victim of Fate seemed in no way consoled.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s beastly cheek, that&#8217;s what
I call it.&#160; Are you new chaps?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The very latest thing,&#8221; said Psmith.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s beastly cheek.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike&#8217;s outlook on life was of
the solid, practical order.&#160; He went straight
to the root of the matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do about it?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>Spiller evaded the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s beastly cheek,&#8221;
he repeated.&#160; &#8220;You can&#8217;t go about the
place bagging studies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we do,&#8221; said Psmith.&#160;
&#8220;In this life, Comrade Spiller, we must be prepared
for every emergency.&#160; We must distinguish between
the unusual and the impossible.&#160; It is unusual
for people to go about the place bagging studies,
so you have rashly ordered your life on the assumption
that it is impossible.&#160; Error!&#160; Ah, Spiller,
Spiller, let this be a lesson to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, I tell you what it&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was in a motor with a man
once.&#160; I said to him:&#160; &#8217;What would happen
if you trod on that pedal thing instead of that other
pedal thing?&#8217; He said, &#8217;I couldn&#8217;t.&#160;
One&#8217;s the foot-brake, and the other&#8217;s the
accelerator.&#8217;&#160; &#8216;But suppose you did?&#8217;
I said.&#160; &#8216;I wouldn&#8217;t,&#8217; he said.&#160;
&#8216;Now we&#8217;ll let her rip.&#8217;&#160; So
he stamped on the accelerator.&#160; Only it turned
out to be the foot-brake after all, and we stopped
dead, and skidded into a ditch.&#160; The advice I
give to every young man starting life is:&#160; &#8216;Never
confuse the unusual and the impossible.&#8217;&#160;
Take the present case.&#160; If you had only realised
the possibility of somebody some day collaring your
study, you might have thought out dozens of sound
schemes for dealing with the matter.&#160; As it is,
you are unprepared.&#160; The thing comes on you as
a surprise.&#160; The cry goes round:&#160; &#8216;Spiller
has been taken unawares.&#160; He cannot cope with the
situation.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t I!&#160; I&#8217;ll&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>are</i> you going to do about it?&#8221;
said Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;All I know is, I&#8217;m going
to have it.&#160; It was Simpson&#8217;s last term,
and Simpson&#8217;s left, and I&#8217;m next on the
house list, so, of course, it&#8217;s my study.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what steps,&#8221; said
Psmith, &#8220;are you going to take?&#160; Spiller,
the man of Logic, we know.&#160; But what of Spiller,
the Man of Action?&#160; How do you intend to set about
it?&#160; Force is useless.&#160; I was saying to Comrade
Jackson before you came in, that I didn&#8217;t mind
betting you were an insignificant-looking little weed.&#160;
And you <i>are</i> an insignificant-looking little
weed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see what Outwood says about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not an unsound scheme.&#160;
By no means a scaly project.&#160; Comrade Jackson
and myself were about to interview him upon another
point.&#160; We may as well all go together.&#8221;</p>

<p>The trio made their way to the Presence,
Spiller pink and determined, Mike sullen, Psmith particularly
debonair.&#160; He hummed lightly as he walked, and
now and then pointed out to Spiller objects of interest
by the wayside.</p>

<p>Mr. Outwood received them with the
motherly warmth which was evidently the leading characteristic
of his normal manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Spiller,&#8221; he said.&#160;
&#8220;And Smith, and Jackson.&#160; I am glad to see
that you have already made friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spiller&#8217;s, sir,&#8221;
said Psmith, laying a hand patronisingly on the study-claimer&#8217;s
shoulder&#8212;&#173;a proceeding violently resented
by Spiller&#8212;&#173;&#8220;is a character one cannot
help but respect.&#160; His nature expands before one
like some beautiful flower.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Outwood received this eulogy with
rather a startled expression, and gazed at the object
of the tribute in a surprised way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Er&#8212;&#173;quite so, Smith,
quite so,&#8221; he said at last.&#160; &#8220;I like
to see boys in my house friendly towards one another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no vice in Spiller,&#8221;
pursued Psmith earnestly.&#160; &#8220;His heart is
the heart of a little child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir,&#8221; burst out
this paragon of all the virtues, &#8220;I&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it was not entirely with
regard to Spiller that I wished to speak to you, sir,
if you were not too busy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all, Smith, not at all.&#160; Is there
anything&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir&#8212;&#173;&#8221; began Spiller.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand, sir,&#8221; said
Psmith, &#8220;that there is an Archaeological Society
in the school.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Outwood&#8217;s eyes sparkled
behind their pince-nez.&#160; It was a disappointment
to him that so few boys seemed to wish to belong to
his chosen band.&#160; Cricket and football, games
that left him cold, appeared to be the main interest
in their lives.&#160; It was but rarely that he could
induce new boys to join.&#160; His colleague, Mr. Downing,
who presided over the School Fire Brigade, never had
any difficulty in finding support.&#160; Boys came
readily at his call.&#160; Mr. Outwood pondered wistfully
on this at times, not knowing that the Fire Brigade
owed its support to the fact that it provided its
light-hearted members with perfectly unparalleled
opportunities for ragging, while his own band, though
small, were in the main earnest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Smith.&#8221; he said.&#160;
&#8220;Yes.&#160; We have a small Archaeological Society.&#160;
I&#8212;&#173;er&#8212;&#173;in a measure look after
it.&#160; Perhaps you would care to become a member?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir&#8212;&#173;&#8221; said Spiller.</p>

<p>&#8220;One moment, Spiller.&#160; Do you want to join,
Smith?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Intensely, sir.&#160; Archaeology fascinates
me.&#160; A grand pursuit, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly, Smith.&#160; I
am very pleased, very pleased indeed.&#160; I will
put down your name at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Jackson&#8217;s, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jackson, too!&#8221; Mr. Outwood
beamed.&#160; &#8220;I am delighted.&#160; Most delighted.&#160;
This is capital.&#160; This enthusiasm is most capital.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spiller, sir,&#8221; said Psmith
sadly, &#8220;I have been unable to induce to join.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he is one of our oldest members.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Psmith, tolerantly, &#8220;that
accounts for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir&#8212;&#173;&#8221; said Spiller.</p>

<p>&#8220;One moment, Spiller.&#160; We
shall have the first outing of the term on Saturday.&#160;
We intend to inspect the Roman Camp at Embury Hill,
two miles from the school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall be there, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Capital!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir&#8212;&#173;&#8221; said Spiller.</p>

<p>&#8220;One moment, Spiller,&#8221;
said Psmith.&#160; &#8220;There is just one other matter,
if you could spare the time, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, Smith.&#160; What is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would there be any objection
to Jackson and myself taking Simpson&#8217;s old study?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By all means, Smith.&#160; A very good idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#160; It would give
us a place where we could work quietly in the evenings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so.&#160; Quite so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you very much, sir.&#160; We will move
our things in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you very much, sir,&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir,&#8221; shouted
Spiller, &#8220;aren&#8217;t I to have it?&#160; I&#8217;m
next on the list, sir.&#160; I come next after Simpson.&#160;
Can&#8217;t I have it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I have already
promised it to Smith, Spiller.&#160; You should have
spoken before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, sir&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>Psmith eyed the speaker pityingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;This tendency to delay, Spiller,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;is your besetting fault.&#160; Correct
it, Edwin.&#160; Fight against it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned to Mr. Outwood.</p>

<p>&#8220;We should, of course, sir,
always be glad to see Spiller in our study.&#160; He
would always find a cheery welcome waiting there for
him.&#160; There is no formality between ourselves
and Spiller.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so.&#160; An excellent
arrangement, Smith.&#160; I like this spirit of comradeship
in my house.&#160; Then you will be with us on Saturday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On Saturday, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All this sort of thing, Spiller,&#8221;
said Psmith, as they closed the door, &#8220;is very,
very trying for a man of culture.&#160; Look us up in
our study one of these afternoons.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch34">
CHAPTER XXXIV<br><br>
GUERRILLA WARFARE</a></h3>

<p>&#8220;There are few pleasures,&#8221;
said Psmith, as he resumed his favourite position
against the mantelpiece and surveyed the commandeered
study with the pride of a householder, &#8220;keener
to the reflective mind than sitting under one&#8217;s
own roof-tree.&#160; This place would have been wasted
on Spiller; he would not have appreciated it properly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike was finishing his tea.&#160; &#8220;You&#8217;re
a jolly useful chap to have by you in a crisis, Smith,&#8221;
he said with approval.&#160; &#8220;We ought to have
known each other before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The loss was mine,&#8221; said
Psmith courteously.&#160; &#8220;We will now, with your
permission, face the future for awhile.&#160; I suppose
you realise that we are now to a certain extent up
against it.&#160; Spiller&#8217;s hot Spanish blood
is not going to sit tight and do nothing under a blow
like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can he do?&#160; Outwood&#8217;s given
us the study.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What would you have done if somebody had bagged
your study?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Made it jolly hot for them!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So will Comrade Spiller.&#160;
I take it that he will collect a gang and make an
offensive movement against us directly he can.&#160;
To all appearances we are in a fairly tight place.&#160;
It all depends on how big Comrade Spiller&#8217;s
gang will be.&#160; I don&#8217;t like rows, but I&#8217;m
prepared to take on a reasonable number of bravoes
in defence of the home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike intimated that he was with him
on the point.&#160; &#8220;The difficulty is, though,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;about when we leave this room.&#160;
I mean, we&#8217;re all right while we stick here,
but we can&#8217;t stay all night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I was
about to point out when you put it with such admirable
clearness.&#160; Here we are in a stronghold, they can
only get at us through the door, and we can lock that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And jam a chair against it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>And</i>, as you rightly
remark, jam a chair against it.&#160; But what of the
nightfall?&#160; What of the time when we retire to
our dormitory?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or dormitories.&#160; I say,
if we&#8217;re in separate rooms we shall be in the
cart.&#8221;</p>

<p>Psmith eyed Mike with approval.&#160;
&#8220;He thinks of everything!&#160; You&#8217;re the
man, Comrade Jackson, to conduct an affair of this
kind&#8212;&#173;such foresight! such resource!&#160;
We must see to this at once; if they put us in different
rooms we&#8217;re done&#8212;&#173;we shall be destroyed
singly in the watches of the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better nip down to the matron right
off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the matron&#8212;&#173;Comrade
Outwood is the man.&#160; We are as sons to him; there
is nothing he can deny us.&#160; I&#8217;m afraid we
are quite spoiling his afternoon by these interruptions,
but we must rout him out once more.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they got up, the door handle rattled
again, and this time there followed a knocking.</p>

<p>&#8220;This must be an emissary of
Comrade Spiller&#8217;s,&#8221; said Psmith.&#160; &#8220;Let
us parley with the man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike unlocked the door.&#160; A light-haired
youth with a cheerful, rather vacant face and a receding
chin strolled into the room, and stood giggling with
his hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>&#8220;I just came up to have a look at you,&#8221;
he explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you move a little to the
left,&#8221; said Psmith, &#8220;you will catch the
light and shade effects on Jackson&#8217;s face better.&#8221;</p>

<p>The new-comer giggled with renewed
vigour.&#160; &#8220;Are you the chap with the eyeglass
who jaws all the time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>do</i> wear an eyeglass,&#8221;
said Psmith; &#8220;as to the rest of the description&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name&#8217;s Jellicoe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine is Psmith&#8212;&#173;P-s-m-i-t-h&#8212;&#173;one
of the Shropshire Psmiths.&#160; The object on the
skyline is Comrade Jackson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Spiller,&#8221; giggled
Jellicoe, &#8220;is cursing you like anything downstairs.&#160;
You <i>are</i> chaps!&#160; Do you mean to say you simply
bagged his study?&#160; He&#8217;s making no end of
a row about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spiller&#8217;s fiery nature is a byword,&#8221;
said Psmith.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he going to do?&#8221; asked Mike,
in his practical way.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s going to get the chaps to turn you
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As I suspected,&#8221; sighed
Psmith, as one mourning over the frailty of human
nature.&#160; &#8220;About how many horny-handed assistants
should you say that he would be likely to bring?&#160;
Will you, for instance, join the glad throng?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me?&#160; No fear!&#160; I think Spiller&#8217;s
an ass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing like
a common thought for binding people together. <i>I</i>
think Spiller&#8217;s an ass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many <i>will</i> there be, then?&#8221;
asked Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;He might get about half a dozen,
not more, because most of the chaps don&#8217;t see
why they should sweat themselves just because Spiller&#8217;s
study has been bagged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sturdy common sense,&#8221;
said Psmith approvingly, &#8220;seems to be the chief
virtue of the Sedleigh character.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall be able to tackle
a crowd like that,&#8221; said Mike.&#160; &#8220;The
only thing is we must get into the same dormitory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is where Comrade Jellicoe&#8217;s
knowledge of the local geography will come in useful.&#160;
Do you happen to know of any snug little room, with,
say, about four beds in it?&#160; How many dormitories
are there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Five&#8212;&#173;there&#8217;s
one with three beds in it, only it belongs to three
chaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe in the equal distribution
of property.&#160; We will go to Comrade Outwood and
stake out another claim.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Outwood received them even more
beamingly than before.&#160; &#8220;Yes, Smith?&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must apologise for disturbing you, sir&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all, Smith, not at all!&#160;
I like the boys in my house to come to me when they
wish for my advice or help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were wondering, sir, if
you would have any objection to Jackson, Jellicoe
and myself sharing the dormitory with the three beds
in it.&#160; A very warm friendship&#8212;&#173;&#8221;
explained Psmith, patting the gurgling Jellicoe kindly
on the shoulder, &#8220;has sprung up between Jackson,
Jellicoe and myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You make friends easily, Smith.&#160;
I like to see it&#8212;&#173;I like to see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And we can have the room, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly&#8212;&#173;certainly!&#160; Tell the
matron as you go down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said Psmith,
as they returned to the study, &#8220;we may say that
we are in a fairly winning position.&#160; A vote of
thanks to Comrade Jellicoe for his valuable assistance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>are</i> a chap!&#8221; said Jellicoe.</p>

<p>The handle began to revolve again.</p>

<p>&#8220;That door,&#8221; said Psmith,
&#8220;is getting a perfect incubus!&#160; It cuts into
one&#8217;s leisure cruelly.&#8221;</p>

<p>This time it was a small boy.&#160;
&#8220;They told me to come up and tell you to come
down,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Psmith looked at him searchingly through his eyeglass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The senior day-room chaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spiller?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spiller and Robinson and Stone, and some other
chaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They want us to speak to them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They told me to come up and tell you to come
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go and give Comrade Spiller
our compliments and say that we can&#8217;t come down,
but shall be delighted to see him up here.&#160; Things,&#8221;
he said, as the messenger departed, &#8220;are beginning
to move.&#160; Better leave the door open, I think;
it will save trouble.&#160; Ah, come in, Comrade Spiller,
what can we do for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Spiller advanced into the study; the
others waited outside, crowding in the doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; said Spiller,
&#8220;are you going to clear out of here or not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After Mr. Outwood&#8217;s kindly
thought in giving us the room?&#160; You suggest a
black and ungrateful action, Comrade Spiller.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get it hot, if you don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll risk it,&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>Jellicoe giggled in the background;
the drama in the atmosphere appealed to him.&#160;
His was a simple and appreciative mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, you chaps,&#8221; cried Spiller suddenly.</p>

<p>There was an inward rush on the enemy&#8217;s
part, but Mike had been watching.&#160; He grabbed
Spiller by the shoulders and ran him back against
the advancing crowd.&#160; For a moment the doorway
was blocked, then the weight and impetus of Mike and
Spiller prevailed, the enemy gave back, and Mike,
stepping into the room again, slammed the door and
locked it.</p>

<p>&#8220;A neat piece of work,&#8221;
said Psmith approvingly, adjusting his tie at the
looking-glass.&#160; &#8220;The preliminaries may now
be considered over, the first shot has been fired.&#160;
The dogs of war are now loose.&#8221;</p>

<p>A heavy body crashed against the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll have it down,&#8221; said Jellicoe.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must act, Comrade Jackson!&#160;
Might I trouble you just to turn that key quietly,
and the handle, and then to stand by for the next
attack.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a scrambling of feet in
the passage outside, and then a repetition of the
onslaught on the door.&#160; This time, however, the
door, instead of resisting, swung open, and the human
battering-ram staggered through into the study.&#160;
Mike, turning after re-locking the door, was just
in time to see Psmith, with a display of energy of
which one would not have believed him capable, grip
the invader scientifically by an arm and a leg.</p>

<p>Mike jumped to help, but it was needless;
the captive was already on the window-sill.&#160; As
Mike arrived, Psmith dropped him on to the flower-bed
below.</p>

<p>Psmith closed the window gently and
turned to Jellicoe.&#160; &#8220;Who was our guest?&#8221;
he asked, dusting the knees of his trousers where they
had pressed against the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Robinson.&#160; I say, you <i>are</i> a chap!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Robinson, was it?&#160; Well,
we are always glad to see Comrade Robinson, always.&#160;
I wonder if anybody else is thinking of calling?&#8221;</p>

<p>Apparently frontal attack had been
abandoned.&#160; Whisperings could be heard in the
corridor.</p>

<p>Somebody hammered on the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; called Psmith patiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better come out,
you know; you&#8217;ll only get it hotter if you don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave us, Spiller; we would be alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>A bell rang in the distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tea,&#8221; said Jellicoe; &#8220;we shall
have to go now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t do anything
till after tea, I shouldn&#8217;t think,&#8221; said
Mike.&#160; &#8220;There&#8217;s no harm in going out.&#8221;</p>

<p>The passage was empty when they opened
the door; the call to food was evidently a thing not
to be treated lightly by the enemy.</p>

<p>In the dining-room the beleaguered
garrison were the object of general attention.&#160;
Everybody turned to look at them as they came in.&#160;
It was plain that the study episode had been a topic
of conversation.&#160; Spiller&#8217;s face was crimson,
and Robinson&#8217;s coat-sleeve still bore traces
of garden mould.</p>

<p>Mike felt rather conscious of the
eyes, but Psmith was in his element.&#160; His demeanour
throughout the meal was that of some whimsical monarch
condescending for a freak to revel with his humble
subjects.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the meal Psmith
scribbled a note and passed it to Mike.&#160; It read:&#160;
&#8220;Directly this is over, nip upstairs as quickly
as you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike followed the advice; they were
first out of the room.&#160; When they had been in
the study a few moments, Jellicoe knocked at the door.&#160;
&#8220;Lucky you two cut away so quick,&#8221; he said.&#160;
&#8220;They were going to try and get you into the
senior day-room and scrag you there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; said Psmith, leaning
against the mantelpiece, &#8220;is exciting, but it
can&#8217;t go on.&#160; We have got for our sins to
be in this place for a whole term, and if we are going
to do the Hunted Fawn business all the time, life
in the true sense of the word will become an impossibility.&#160;
My nerves are so delicately attuned that the strain
would simply reduce them to hash.&#160; We are not
prepared to carry on a long campaign&#8212;&#173;the
thing must be settled at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we go down to the senior
day-room, and have it out?&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, we will play the fixture
on our own ground.&#160; I think we may take it as
tolerably certain that Comrade Spiller and his hired
ruffians will try to corner us in the dormitory to-night.&#160;
Well, of course, we could fake up some sort of barricade
for the door, but then we should have all the trouble
over again to-morrow and the day after that.&#160;
Personally I don&#8217;t propose to be chivvied about
indefinitely like this, so I propose that we let them
come into the dormitory, and see what happens.&#160;
Is this meeting with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s sound,&#8221;
said Mike.&#160; &#8220;We needn&#8217;t drag Jellicoe
into it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As a matter of fact&#8212;&#173;if
you don&#8217;t mind&#8212;&#173;&#8221; began that
man of peace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite right,&#8221; said Psmith;
&#8220;this is not Comrade Jellicoe&#8217;s scene at
all; he has got to spend the term in the senior day-room,
whereas we have our little wooden <i>ch&#226;let</i> to
retire to in times of stress.&#160; Comrade Jellicoe
must stand out of the game altogether.&#160; We shall
be glad of his moral support, but otherwise, <i>ne
pas</i>.&#160; And now, as there won&#8217;t be anything
doing till bedtime, I think I&#8217;ll collar this
table and write home and tell my people that all is
well with their Rupert.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch35">
CHAPTER XXXV<br><br>
UNPLEASANTNESS IN THE SMALL HOURS</a></h3>

<p>Jellicoe, that human encyclopaedia,
consulted on the probable movements of the enemy,
deposed that Spiller, retiring at ten, would make
for Dormitory One in the same passage, where Robinson
also had a bed.&#160; The rest of the opposing forces
were distributed among other and more distant rooms.&#160;
It was probable, therefore, that Dormitory One would
be the rendezvous.&#160; As to the time when an attack
might be expected, it was unlikely that it would occur
before half-past eleven.&#160; Mr. Outwood went the
round of the dormitories at eleven.</p>

<p>&#8220;And touching,&#8221; said Psmith,
&#8220;the matter of noise, must this business be
conducted in a subdued and <i>sotto voce</i> manner,
or may we let ourselves go a bit here and there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t think old
Outwood&#8217;s likely to hear you&#8212;&#173;he sleeps
miles away on the other side of the house.&#160; He
never hears anything.&#160; We often rag half the night
and nothing happens.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This appears to be a thoroughly nice,
well-conducted establishment.&#160; What would my mother
say if she could see her Rupert in the midst of these
reckless youths!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the better,&#8221; said
Mike; &#8220;we don&#8217;t want anybody butting in
and stopping the show before it&#8217;s half started.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Comrade Jackson&#8217;s Berserk
blood is up&#8212;&#173;I can hear it sizzling.&#160;
I quite agree these things are all very disturbing
and painful, but it&#8217;s as well to do them thoroughly
when one&#8217;s once in for them.&#160; Is there nobody
else who might interfere with our gambols?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Barnes might,&#8221; said Jellicoe, &#8220;only
he won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is Barnes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Head of the house&#8212;&#173;a
rotter.&#160; He&#8217;s in a funk of Stone and Robinson;
they rag him; he&#8217;ll simply sit tight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I think,&#8221; said Psmith
placidly, &#8220;we may look forward to a very pleasant
evening.&#160; Shall we be moving?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Outwood paid his visit at eleven,
as predicted by Jellicoe, beaming vaguely into the
darkness over a candle, and disappeared again, closing
the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about that door?&#8221;
said Mike.&#160; &#8220;Shall we leave it open for them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so, but far otherwise.&#160;
If it&#8217;s shut we shall hear them at it when they
come.&#160; Subject to your approval, Comrade Jackson,
I have evolved the following plan of action.&#160;
I always ask myself on these occasions, &#8216;What
would Napoleon have done?&#8217; I think Napoleon would
have sat in a chair by his washhand-stand, which is
close to the door; he would have posted you by your
washhand-stand, and he would have instructed Comrade
Jellicoe, directly he heard the door-handle turned,
to give his celebrated imitation of a dormitory breathing
heavily in its sleep.&#160; He would then&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you what,&#8221; said
Mike, &#8220;how about tying a string at the top of
the steps?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Napoleon would have done
that, too.&#160; Hats off to Comrade Jackson, the man
with the big brain!&#8221;</p>

<p>The floor of the dormitory was below
the level of the door.&#160; There were three steps
leading down to it.&#160; Psmith lit a candle and they
examined the ground.&#160; The leg of a wardrobe and
the leg of Jellicoe&#8217;s bed made it possible for
the string to be fastened in a satisfactory manner
across the lower step.&#160; Psmith surveyed the result
with approval.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dashed neat!&#8221; he said.&#160;
&#8220;Practically the sunken road which dished the
Cuirassiers at Waterloo.&#160; I seem to see Comrade
Spiller coming one of the finest purlers in the world&#8217;s
history.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If they&#8217;ve got a candle&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t have.&#160;
If they have, stand by with your water-jug and douse
it at once; then they&#8217;ll charge forward and all
will be well.&#160; If they have no candle, fling the
water at a venture&#8212;&#173;fire into the brown!&#160;
Lest we forget, I&#8217;ll collar Comrade Jellicoe&#8217;s
jug now and keep it handy.&#160; A couple of sheets
would also not be amiss&#8212;&#173;we will enmesh the
enemy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right ho!&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;These humane preparations being
concluded,&#8221; said Psmith, &#8220;we will retire
to our posts and wait.&#160; Comrade Jellicoe, don&#8217;t
forget to breathe like an asthmatic sheep when you
hear the door opened; they may wait at the top of
the steps, listening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>are</i> a chap!&#8221; said Jellicoe.</p>

<p>Waiting in the dark for something
to happen is always a trying experience, especially
if, as on this occasion, silence is essential.&#160;
Mike found his thoughts wandering back to the vigil
he had kept with Mr. Wain at Wrykyn on the night when
Wyatt had come in through the window and found authority
sitting on his bed, waiting for him.&#160; Mike was
tired after his journey, and he had begun to doze when
he was jerked back to wakefulness by the stealthy
turning of the door-handle; the faintest rustle from
Psmith&#8217;s direction followed, and a slight giggle,
succeeded by a series of deep breaths, showed that
Jellicoe, too, had heard the noise.</p>

<p>There was a creaking sound.</p>

<p>It was pitch-dark in the dormitory,
but Mike could follow the invaders&#8217; movements
as clearly as if it had been broad daylight.&#160; They
had opened the door and were listening.&#160; Jellicoe&#8217;s
breathing grew more asthmatic; he was flinging himself
into his part with the whole-heartedness of the true
artist.</p>

<p>The creak was followed by a sound
of whispering, then another creak.&#160; The enemy
had advanced to the top step....&#160; Another creak....&#160;
The vanguard had reached the second step....&#160;
In another moment&#8212;&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>CRASH!</p>

<p>And at that point the proceedings may be said to have
formally opened.</p>

<p>A struggling mass bumped against Mike&#8217;s
shins as he rose from his chair; he emptied his jug
on to this mass, and a yell of anguish showed that
the contents had got to the right address.</p>

<p>Then a hand grabbed his ankle and
he went down, a million sparks dancing before his
eyes as a fist, flying out at a venture, caught him
on the nose.</p>

<p>Mike had not been well-disposed towards
the invaders before, but now he ran amok, hitting
out right and left at random.&#160; His right missed,
but his left went home hard on some portion of somebody&#8217;s
anatomy.&#160; A kick freed his ankle and he staggered
to his feet.&#160; At the same moment a sudden increase
in the general volume of noise spoke eloquently of
good work that was being put in by Psmith.</p>

<p>Even at that crisis, Mike could not
help feeling that if a row of this calibre did not
draw Mr. Outwood from his bed, he must be an unusual
kind of house-master.</p>

<p>He plunged forward again with outstretched
arms, and stumbled and fell over one of the on-the-floor
section of the opposing force.&#160; They seized each
other earnestly and rolled across the room till Mike,
contriving to secure his adversary&#8217;s head, bumped
it on the floor with such abandon that, with a muffled
yell, the other let go, and for the second time he
rose.&#160; As he did so he was conscious of a curious
thudding sound that made itself heard through the other
assorted noises of the battle.</p>

<p>All this time the fight had gone on
in the blackest darkness, but now a light shone on
the proceedings.&#160; Interested occupants of other
dormitories, roused from their slumbers, had come to
observe the sport.&#160; They were crowding in the
doorway with a candle.</p>

<p>By the light of this Mike got a swift
view of the theatre of war.&#160; The enemy appeared
to number five.&#160; The warrior whose head Mike had
bumped on the floor was Robinson, who was sitting
up feeling his skull in a gingerly fashion.&#160; To
Mike&#8217;s right, almost touching him, was Stone.&#160;
In the direction of the door, Psmith, wielding in
his right hand the cord of a dressing-gown, was engaging
the remaining three with a patient smile.&#160; They
were clad in pyjamas, and appeared to be feeling the
dressing-gown cord acutely.</p>

<p>The sudden light dazed both sides
momentarily.&#160; The defence was the first to recover,
Mike, with a swing, upsetting Stone, and Psmith, having
seized and emptied Jellicoe&#8217;s jug over Spiller,
getting to work again with the cord in a manner that
roused the utmost enthusiasm of the spectators.</p>

<center><a name="illus8">
<img src="images/jmike8.jpg" alt="PSMITH SEIZED AND EMPTIED JELLICOE&#8217;S JUG OVER SPILLER">
</a></center>

<p>Agility seemed to be the leading feature
of Psmith&#8217;s tactics.&#160; He was everywhere&#8212;&#173;on
Mike&#8217;s bed, on his own, on Jellicoe&#8217;s (drawing
a passionate complaint from that non-combatant, on
whose face he inadvertently trod), on the floor&#8212;&#173;he
ranged the room, sowing destruction.</p>

<p>The enemy were disheartened; they
had started with the idea that this was to be a surprise
attack, and it was disconcerting to find the garrison
armed at all points.&#160; Gradually they edged to the
door, and a final rush sent them through.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold the door for a second,&#8221;
cried Psmith, and vanished.&#160; Mike was alone in
the doorway.</p>

<p>It was a situation which exactly suited
his frame of mind; he stood alone in direct opposition
to the community into which Fate had pitchforked him
so abruptly.&#160; He liked the feeling; for the first
time since his father had given him his views upon
school reports that morning in the Easter holidays,
he felt satisfied with life.&#160; He hoped, outnumbered
as he was, that the enemy would come on again and not
give the thing up in disgust; he wanted more.</p>

<p>On an occasion like this there is
rarely anything approaching concerted action on the
part of the aggressors.&#160; When the attack came,
it was not a combined attack; Stone, who was nearest
to the door, made a sudden dash forward, and Mike
hit him under the chin.</p>

<p>Stone drew back, and there was another
interval for rest and reflection.</p>

<p>It was interrupted by the reappearance
of Psmith, who strolled back along the passage swinging
his dressing-gown cord as if it were some clouded
cane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry to keep you waiting,
Comrade Jackson,&#8221; he said politely.&#160; &#8220;Duty
called me elsewhere.&#160; With the kindly aid of a
guide who knows the lie of the land, I have been making
a short tour of the dormitories.&#160; I have poured
divers jugfuls of water over Comrade Spiller&#8217;s
bed, Comrade Robinson&#8217;s bed, Comrade Stone&#8217;s&#8212;&#173;Spiller,
Spiller, these are harsh words; where you pick them
up I can&#8217;t think&#8212;&#173;not from me.&#160;
Well, well, I suppose there must be an end to the
pleasantest of functions.&#160; Good-night, good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>The door closed behind Mike and himself.&#160;
For ten minutes shufflings and whisperings went on
in the corridor, but nobody touched the handle.</p>

<p>Then there was a sound of retreating
footsteps, and silence reigned.</p>

<p>On the following morning there was
a notice on the house-board.&#160; It ran:&#160;</p>

<center><a name="illus13">
<img src="images/jmike13.png" alt="INDOOR GAMES: Dormitory-raiders are informed that in future neither

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch36">
CHAPTER XXXVI<br><br>
ADAIR</a></h3>

<p>On the same morning Mike met Adair for the first time.</p>

<p>He was going across to school with
Psmith and Jellicoe, when a group of three came out
of the gate of the house next door.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Adair,&#8221; said Jellicoe, &#8220;in
the middle.&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice had assumed a tone almost of awe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s Adair?&#8221; asked Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain of cricket, and lots of other things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike could only see the celebrity&#8217;s
back.&#160; He had broad shoulders and wiry, light
hair, almost white.&#160; He walked well, as if he were
used to running.&#160; Altogether a fit-looking sort
of man.&#160; Even Mike&#8217;s jaundiced eye saw that.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Adair deserved
more than a casual glance.&#160; He was that rare type,
the natural leader.&#160; Many boys and men, if accident,
or the passage of time, places them in a position
where they are expected to lead, can handle the job
without disaster; but that is a very different thing
from being a born leader.&#160; Adair was of the sort
that comes to the top by sheer force of character
and determination.&#160; He was not naturally clever
at work, but he had gone at it with a dogged resolution
which had carried him up the school, and landed him
high in the Sixth.&#160; As a cricketer he was almost
entirely self-taught.&#160; Nature had given him a
good eye, and left the thing at that.&#160; Adair&#8217;s
doggedness had triumphed over her failure to do her
work thoroughly.&#160; At the cost of more trouble
than most people give to their life-work he had made
himself into a bowler.&#160; He read the authorities,
and watched first-class players, and thought the thing
out on his own account, and he divided the art of
bowling into three sections.&#160; First, and most
important&#8212;&#173;pitch.&#160; Second on the list&#8212;&#173;break.&#160;
Third&#8212;&#173;pace.&#160; He set himself to acquire
pitch.&#160; He acquired it.&#160; Bowling at his own
pace and without any attempt at break, he could now
drop the ball on an envelope seven times out of ten.</p>

<p>Break was a more uncertain quantity.&#160;
Sometimes he could get it at the expense of pitch,
sometimes at the expense of pace.&#160; Some days he
could get all three, and then he was an uncommonly
bad man to face on anything but a plumb wicket.</p>

<p>Running he had acquired in a similar
manner.&#160; He had nothing approaching style, but
he had twice won the mile and half-mile at the Sports
off elegant runners, who knew all about stride and
the correct timing of the sprints and all the rest
of it.</p>

<p>Briefly, he was a worker.&#160; He had heart.</p>

<p>A boy of Adair&#8217;s type is always
a force in a school.&#160; In a big public school of
six or seven hundred, his influence is felt less; but
in a small school like Sedleigh he is like a tidal
wave, sweeping all before him.&#160; There were two
hundred boys at Sedleigh, and there was not one of
them in all probability who had not, directly or indirectly,
been influenced by Adair.&#160; As a small boy his sphere
was not large, but the effects of his work began to
be apparent even then.&#160; It is human nature to
want to get something which somebody else obviously
values very much; and when it was observed by members
of his form that Adair was going to great trouble
and inconvenience to secure a place in the form eleven
or fifteen, they naturally began to think, too, that
it was worth being in those teams.&#160; The consequence
was that his form always played hard.&#160; This made
other forms play hard.&#160; And the net result was
that, when Adair succeeded to the captaincy of football
and cricket in the same year, Sedleigh, as Mr. Downing,
Adair&#8217;s house-master and the nearest approach
to a cricket-master that Sedleigh possessed, had a
fondness for saying, was a keen school.&#160; As a
whole, it both worked and played with energy.</p>

<p>All it wanted now was opportunity.</p>

<p>This Adair was determined to give
it.&#160; He had that passionate fondness for his school
which every boy is popularly supposed to have, but
which really is implanted in about one in every thousand.&#160;
The average public-school boy <i>likes</i> his school.&#160;
He hopes it will lick Bedford at footer and Malvern
at cricket, but he rather bets it won&#8217;t.&#160;
He is sorry to leave, and he likes going back at the
end of the holidays, but as for any passionate, deep-seated
love of the place, he would think it rather bad form
than otherwise.&#160; If anybody came up to him, slapped
him on the back, and cried, &#8220;Come along, Jenkins,
my boy!&#160; Play up for the old school, Jenkins!&#160;
The dear old school!&#160; The old place you love so!&#8221;
he would feel seriously ill.</p>

<p>Adair was the exception.</p>

<p>To Adair, Sedleigh was almost a religion.&#160;
Both his parents were dead; his guardian, with whom
he spent the holidays, was a man with neuralgia at
one end of him and gout at the other; and the only
really pleasant times Adair had had, as far back as
he could remember, he owed to Sedleigh.&#160; The place
had grown on him, absorbed him.&#160; Where Mike, violently
transplanted from Wrykyn, saw only a wretched little
hole not to be mentioned in the same breath with Wrykyn,
Adair, dreaming of the future, saw a colossal establishment,
a public school among public schools, a lump of human
radium, shooting out Blues and Balliol Scholars year
after year without ceasing.</p>

<p>It would not be so till long after
he was gone and forgotten, but he did not mind that.&#160;
His devotion to Sedleigh was purely unselfish.&#160;
He did not want fame.&#160; All he worked for was that
the school should grow and grow, keener and better
at games and more prosperous year by year, till it
should take its rank among <i>the</i> schools, and
to be an Old Sedleighan should be a badge passing
its owner everywhere.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s captain of cricket
and footer,&#8221; said Jellicoe impressively.&#160;
&#8220;He&#8217;s in the shooting eight.&#160; He&#8217;s
won the mile and half two years running.&#160; He would
have boxed at Aldershot last term, only he sprained
his wrist.&#160; And he plays fives jolly well!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sort of little tin god,&#8221;
said Mike, taking a violent dislike to Adair from
that moment.</p>

<p>Mike&#8217;s actual acquaintance with
this all-round man dated from the dinner-hour that
day.&#160; Mike was walking to the house with Psmith.&#160;
Psmith was a little ruffled on account of a slight
passage-of-arms he had had with his form-master during
morning school.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;There&#8217;s a P before
the Smith,&#8217; I said to him.&#160; &#8216;Ah, P.
Smith, I see,&#8217; replied the goat.&#160; &#8216;Not
Peasmith,&#8217; I replied, exercising wonderful self-restraint,
&#8216;just Psmith.&#8217;&#160; It took me ten minutes
to drive the thing into the man&#8217;s head; and
when I <i>had</i> driven it in, he sent me out of
the room for looking at him through my eye-glass.&#160;
Comrade Jackson, I fear me we have fallen among bad
men.&#160; I suspect that we are going to be much persecuted
by scoundrels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Both you chaps play cricket, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>They turned.&#160; It was Adair.&#160;
Seeing him face to face, Mike was aware of a pair
of very bright blue eyes and a square jaw.&#160; In
any other place and mood he would have liked Adair
at sight.&#160; His prejudice, however, against all
things Sedleighan was too much for him.&#160; &#8220;I
don&#8217;t,&#8221; he said shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you <i>ever</i> played?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My little sister and I sometimes play with
a soft ball at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adair looked sharply at him.&#160;
A temper was evidently one of his numerous qualities.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;Well,
perhaps you wouldn&#8217;t mind turning out this afternoon
and seeing what you can do with a hard ball&#8212;&#173;if
you can manage without your little sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think the form at
this place would be about on a level with hers.&#160;
But I don&#8217;t happen to be playing cricket, as
I think I told you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adair&#8217;s jaw grew squarer than
ever.&#160; Mike was wearing a gloomy scowl.</p>

<p>Psmith joined suavely in the dialogue.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear old comrades,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;don&#8217;t let us brawl over this
matter.&#160; This is a time for the honeyed word,
the kindly eye, and the pleasant smile.&#160; Let me
explain to Comrade Adair.&#160; Speaking for Comrade
Jackson and myself, we should both be delighted to
join in the mimic warfare of our National Game, as
you suggest, only the fact is, we happen to be the
Young Archaeologists.&#160; We gave in our names last
night.&#160; When you are being carried back to the
pavilion after your century against Loamshire&#8212;&#173;do
you play Loamshire?&#8212;&#173;we shall be grubbing
in the hard ground for ruined abbeys.&#160; The old
choice between Pleasure and Duty, Comrade Adair.&#160;
A Boy&#8217;s Cross-Roads.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you won&#8217;t play?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Archaeology,&#8221; said Psmith,
with a deprecatory wave of the hand, &#8220;will brook
no divided allegiance from her devotees.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adair turned, and walked on.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he gone, when another
voice hailed them with precisely the same question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Both you fellows are going to play cricket,
eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a master.&#160; A short, wiry
little man with a sharp nose and a general resemblance,
both in manner and appearance, to an excitable bullfinch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw Adair speaking to you.&#160;
I suppose you will both play.&#160; I like every new
boy to begin at once.&#160; The more new blood we have,
the better.&#160; We want keenness here.&#160; We are,
above all, a keen school.&#160; I want every boy to
be keen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are, sir,&#8221; said Psmith, with fervour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On archaeology.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downing&#8212;&#173;for it was
no less a celebrity&#8212;&#173;started, as one who
perceives a loathly caterpillar in his salad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Archaeology!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We gave in our names to Mr.
Outwood last night, sir.&#160; Archaeology is a passion
with us, sir.&#160; When we heard that there was a society
here, we went singing about the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I call it an unnatural pursuit
for boys,&#8221; said Mr. Downing vehemently.&#160;
&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it.&#160; I tell you I don&#8217;t
like it.&#160; It is not for me to interfere with one
of my colleagues on the staff, but I tell you frankly
that in my opinion it is an abominable waste of time
for a boy.&#160; It gets him into idle, loafing habits.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never loaf, sir,&#8221; said Psmith.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was not alluding to you in
particular.&#160; I was referring to the principle
of the thing.&#160; A boy ought to be playing cricket
with other boys, not wandering at large about the
country, probably smoking and going into low public-houses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A very wild lot, sir, I fear,
the Archaeological Society here,&#8221; sighed Psmith,
shaking his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you choose to waste your
time, I suppose I can&#8217;t hinder you.&#160; But
in my opinion it is foolery, nothing else.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stumped off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now <i>he&#8217;s</i> cross,&#8221;
said Psmith, looking after him.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m
afraid we&#8217;re getting ourselves disliked here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good job, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At any rate, Comrade Outwood
loves us.&#160; Let&#8217;s go on and see what sort
of a lunch that large-hearted fossil-fancier is going
to give us.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch37">
CHAPTER XXXVII<br><br>
MIKE FINDS OCCUPATION</a></h3>

<p>There was more than one moment during
the first fortnight of term when Mike found himself
regretting the attitude he had imposed upon himself
with regard to Sedleighan cricket.&#160; He began to
realise the eternal truth of the proverb about half
a loaf and no bread.&#160; In the first flush of his
resentment against his new surroundings he had refused
to play cricket.&#160; And now he positively ached
for a game.&#160; Any sort of a game.&#160; An innings
for a Kindergarten <i>v.</i> the Second Eleven of a
Home of Rest for Centenarians would have soothed him.&#160;
There were times, when the sun shone, and he caught
sight of white flannels on a green ground, and heard
the &#8220;plonk&#8221; of bat striking ball, when
he felt like rushing to Adair and shouting, &#8220;I
<i>will</i> be good.&#160; I was in the Wrykyn team
three years, and had an average of over fifty the last
two seasons.&#160; Lead me to the nearest net, and let
me feel a bat in my hands again.&#8221;</p>

<p>But every time he shrank from such
a climb down.&#160; It couldn&#8217;t be done.</p>

<p>What made it worse was that he saw,
after watching behind the nets once or twice, that
Sedleigh cricket was not the childish burlesque of
the game which he had been rash enough to assume that
it must be.&#160; Numbers do not make good cricket.&#160;
They only make the presence of good cricketers more
likely, by the law of averages.</p>

<p>Mike soon saw that cricket was by
no means an unknown art at Sedleigh.&#160; Adair, to
begin with, was a very good bowler indeed.&#160; He
was not a Burgess, but Burgess was the only Wrykyn
bowler whom, in his three years&#8217; experience
of the school, Mike would have placed above him.&#160;
He was a long way better than Neville-Smith, and Wyatt,
and Milton, and the others who had taken wickets for
Wrykyn.</p>

<p>The batting was not so good, but there
were some quite capable men.&#160; Barnes, the head
of Outwood&#8217;s, he who preferred not to interfere
with Stone and Robinson, was a mild, rather timid-looking
youth&#8212;&#173;not unlike what Mr. Outwood must
have been as a boy&#8212;&#173;but he knew how to keep
balls out of his wicket.&#160; He was a good bat of
the old plodding type.</p>

<p>Stone and Robinson themselves, that
swash-buckling pair, who now treated Mike and Psmith
with cold but consistent politeness, were both fair
batsmen, and Stone was a good slow bowler.</p>

<p>There were other exponents of the
game, mostly in Downing&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>Altogether, quite worthy colleagues
even for a man who had been a star at Wrykyn.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>One solitary overture Mike made during
that first fortnight.&#160; He did not repeat the experiment.&#160;
It was on a Thursday afternoon, after school.&#160;
The day was warm, but freshened by an almost imperceptible
breeze.&#160; The air was full of the scent of the cut
grass which lay in little heaps behind the nets.&#160;
This is the real cricket scent, which calls to one
like the very voice of the game.</p>

<p>Mike, as he sat there watching, could
stand it no longer.</p>

<p>He went up to Adair.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I have an innings at this
net?&#8221; he asked.&#160; He was embarrassed and
nervous, and was trying not to show it.&#160; The natural
result was that his manner was offensively abrupt.</p>

<p>Adair was taking off his pads after
his innings.&#160; He looked up.&#160; &#8220;This net,&#8221;
it may be observed, was the first eleven net.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Mike repeated his request.&#160; More
abruptly this time, from increased embarrassment.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the first eleven net,&#8221;
said Adair coldly.&#160; &#8220;Go in after Lodge over
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Over there&#8221; was the end
net, where frenzied novices were bowling on a corrugated
pitch to a red-haired youth with enormous feet, who
looked as if he were taking his first lesson at the
game.</p>

<p>Mike walked away without a word.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>The Archaeological Society expeditions,
even though they carried with them the privilege of
listening to Psmith&#8217;s views on life, proved but
a poor substitute for cricket.&#160; Psmith, who had
no counter-attraction shouting to him that he ought
to be elsewhere, seemed to enjoy them hugely, but
Mike almost cried sometimes from boredom.&#160; It was
not always possible to slip away from the throng,
for Mr. Outwood evidently looked upon them as among
the very faithful, and kept them by his aide.</p>

<p>Mike on these occasions was silent
and jumpy, his brow &#8220;sicklied o&#8217;er with
the pale cast of care.&#8221;&#160; But Psmith followed
his leader with the pleased and indulgent air of a
father whose infant son is showing him round the garden.&#160;
Psmith&#8217;s attitude towards archaeological research
struck a new note in the history of that neglected
science.&#160; He was amiable, but patronising.&#160;
He patronised fossils, and he patronised ruins.&#160;
If he had been confronted with the Great Pyramid, he
would have patronised that.</p>

<p>He seemed to be consumed by a thirst for knowledge.</p>

<p>That this was not altogether a genuine
thirst was proved on the third expedition.&#160; Mr.
Outwood and his band were pecking away at the site
of an old Roman camp.&#160; Psmith approached Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Having inspired confidence,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;by the docility of our demeanour,
let us slip away, and brood apart for awhile.&#160;
Roman camps, to be absolutely accurate, give me the
pip.&#160; And I never want to see another putrid fossil
in my life.&#160; Let us find some shady nook where
a man may lie on his back for a bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike, over whom the proceedings connected
with the Roman camp had long since begun to shed a
blue depression, offered no opposition, and they strolled
away down the hill.</p>

<p>Looking back, they saw that the archaeologists
were still hard at it.&#160; Their departure had passed
unnoticed.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fatiguing pursuit, this grubbing
for mementoes of the past,&#8221; said Psmith.&#160;
&#8220;And, above all, dashed bad for the knees of
the trousers.&#160; Mine are like some furrowed field.&#160;
It&#8217;s a great grief to a man of refinement, I
can tell you, Comrade Jackson.&#160; Ah, this looks
a likely spot.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had passed through a gate into
the field beyond.&#160; At the further end there was
a brook, shaded by trees and running with a pleasant
sound over pebbles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thus far,&#8221; said Psmith,
hitching up the knees of his trousers, and sitting
down, &#8220;and no farther.&#160; We will rest here
awhile, and listen to the music of the brook.&#160;
In fact, unless you have anything important to say,
I rather think I&#8217;ll go to sleep.&#160; In this
busy life of ours these naps by the wayside are invaluable.&#160;
Call me in about an hour.&#8221;&#160; And Psmith,
heaving the comfortable sigh of the worker who by toil
has earned rest, lay down, with his head against a
mossy tree-stump, and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>Mike sat on for a few minutes, listening
to the water and making centuries in his mind, and
then, finding this a little dull, he got up, jumped
the brook, and began to explore the wood on the other
side.</p>

<p>He had not gone many yards when a
dog emerged suddenly from the undergrowth, and began
to bark vigorously at him.</p>

<p>Mike liked dogs, and, on acquaintance,
they always liked him.&#160; But when you meet a dog
in some one else&#8217;s wood, it is as well not to
stop in order that you may get to understand each
other.&#160; Mike began to thread his way back through
the trees.</p>

<p>He was too late.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#160; What the dickens
are you doing here?&#8221; shouted a voice behind
him.</p>

<p>In the same situation a few years
before, Mike would have carried on, and trusted to
speed to save him.&#160; But now there seemed a lack
of dignity in the action.&#160; He came back to where
the man was standing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry if I&#8217;m
trespassing,&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;I was just
having a look round.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The dickens you&#8212;&#173;Why, you&#8217;re
Jackson!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike looked at him.&#160; He was a
short, broad young man with a fair moustache.&#160;
Mike knew that he had seen him before somewhere, but
he could not place him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I played against you, for the
Free Foresters last summer.&#160; In passing, you seem
to be a bit of a free forester yourself, dancing in
among my nesting pheasants.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m frightfully sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right.&#160; Where do you spring
from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course&#8212;&#173;I remember
you now.&#160; You&#8217;re Prendergast.&#160; You made
fifty-eight not out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks.&#160; I was afraid the
only thing you would remember about me was that you
took a century mostly off my bowling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to have had me second
ball, only cover dropped it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t rake up forgotten
tragedies.&#160; How is it you&#8217;re not at Wrykyn?&#160;
What are you doing down here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve left Wrykyn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prendergast suddenly changed the conversation.&#160;
When a fellow tells you that he has left school unexpectedly,
it is not always tactful to inquire the reason.&#160;
He began to talk about himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hang out down here.&#160;
I do a little farming and a good deal of pottering
about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get any cricket?&#8221; asked
Mike, turning to the subject next his heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only village.&#160; Very keen,
but no great shakes.&#160; By the way, how are you
off for cricket now?&#160; Have you ever got a spare
afternoon?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike&#8217;s heart leaped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any Wednesday or Saturday.&#160; Look here,
I&#8217;ll tell you how it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he told how matters stood with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, you see,&#8221; he concluded,
&#8220;I&#8217;m supposed to be hunting for ruins and
things&#8221;&#8212;&#173;Mike&#8217;s ideas on the
subject of archaeology were vague&#8212;&#173;&#8220;but
I could always slip away.&#160; We all start out together,
but I could nip back, get on to my bike&#8212;&#173;I&#8217;ve
got it down here&#8212;&#173;and meet you anywhere
you liked.&#160; By Jove, I&#8217;m simply dying for
a game.&#160; I can hardly keep my hands off a bat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you all you
want.&#160; What you&#8217;d better do is to ride straight
to Lower Borlock&#8212;&#173;that&#8217;s the name of
the place&#8212;&#173;and I&#8217;ll meet you on the
ground.&#160; Any one will tell you where Lower Borlock
is.&#160; It&#8217;s just off the London road.&#160;
There&#8217;s a sign-post where you turn off.&#160;
Can you come next Saturday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather.&#160; I suppose you
can fix me up with a bat and pads?&#160; I don&#8217;t
want to bring mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll lend you everything.&#160;
I say, you know, we can&#8217;t give you a Wrykyn
wicket.&#160; The Lower Borlock pitch isn&#8217;t a
shirt-front.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll play on a rockery, if you want me
to,&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to what?&#8221;
asked Psmith, sleepily, on being awakened and told
the news.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to play cricket,
for a village near here.&#160; I say, don&#8217;t tell
a soul, will you?&#160; I don&#8217;t want it to get
about, or I may get lugged in to play for the school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My lips are sealed.&#160; I
think I&#8217;ll come and watch you.&#160; Cricket I
dislike, but watching cricket is one of the finest
of Britain&#8217;s manly sports.&#160; I&#8217;ll borrow
Jellicoe&#8217;s bicycle.&#8221;</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>That Saturday, Lower Borlock smote
the men of Chidford hip and thigh.&#160; Their victory
was due to a hurricane innings of seventy-five by a
new-comer to the team, M. Jackson.</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch38">
CHAPTER XXXVIII<br><br>
THE FIRE BRIGADE MEETING</a></h3>

<p>Cricket is the great safety-valve.&#160;
If you like the game, and are in a position to play
it at least twice a week, life can never be entirely
grey.&#160; As time went on, and his average for Lower
Borlock reached the fifties and stayed there, Mike
began, though he would not have admitted it, to enjoy
himself.&#160; It was not Wrykyn, but it was a very
decent substitute.</p>

<p>The only really considerable element
making for discomfort now was Mr. Downing.&#160; By
bad luck it was in his form that Mike had been placed
on arrival; and Mr. Downing, never an easy form-master
to get on with, proved more than usually difficult
in his dealings with Mike.</p>

<p>They had taken a dislike to each other
at their first meeting; and it grew with further acquaintance.&#160;
To Mike, Mr. Downing was all that a master ought not
to be, fussy, pompous, and openly influenced in his
official dealings with his form by his own private
likes and dislikes.&#160; To Mr. Downing, Mike was
simply an unamiable loafer, who did nothing for the
school and apparently had none of the instincts which
should be implanted in the healthy boy.&#160; Mr. Downing
was rather strong on the healthy boy.</p>

<p>The two lived in a state of simmering
hostility, punctuated at intervals by crises, which
usually resulted in Lower Borlock having to play some
unskilled labourer in place of their star batsman,
employed doing &#8220;over-time.&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the most acute of these crises,
and the most important, in that it was the direct
cause of Mike&#8217;s appearance in Sedleigh cricket,
had to do with the third weekly meeting of the School
Fire Brigade.</p>

<p>It may be remembered that this well-supported
institution was under Mr. Downing&#8217;s special
care.&#160; It was, indeed, his pet hobby and the apple
of his eye.</p>

<p>Just as you had to join the Archaeological
Society to secure the esteem of Mr. Outwood, so to
become a member of the Fire Brigade was a safe passport
to the regard of Mr. Downing.&#160; To show a keenness
for cricket was good, but to join the Fire Brigade
was best of all.&#160; The Brigade was carefully organised.&#160;
At its head was Mr. Downing, a sort of high priest;
under him was a captain, and under the captain a vice-captain.&#160;
These two officials were those sportive allies, Stone
and Robinson, of Outwood&#8217;s house, who, having
perceived at a very early date the gorgeous opportunities
for ragging which the Brigade offered to its members,
had joined young and worked their way up.</p>

<p>Under them were the rank and file,
about thirty in all, of whom perhaps seven were earnest
workers, who looked on the Brigade in the right, or
Downing, spirit.&#160; The rest were entirely frivolous.</p>

<p>The weekly meetings were always full
of life and excitement.</p>

<p>At this point it is as well to introduce
Sammy to the reader.</p>

<p>Sammy, short for Sampson, was a young
bull-terrier belonging to Mr. Downing.&#160; If it
is possible for a man to have two apples of his eye,
Sammy was the other.&#160; He was a large, light-hearted
dog with a white coat, an engaging expression, the
tongue of an ant-eater, and a manner which was a happy
blend of hurricane and circular saw.&#160; He had long
legs, a tenor voice, and was apparently made of india-rubber.</p>

<p>Sammy was a great favourite in the
school, and a particular friend of Mike&#8217;s, the
Wrykynian being always a firm ally of every dog he
met after two minutes&#8217; acquaintance.</p>

<p>In passing, Jellicoe owned a clock-work
rat, much in request during French lessons.</p>

<p>We will now proceed to the painful details.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>The meetings of the Fire Brigade were
held after school in Mr. Downing&#8217;s form-room.&#160;
The proceedings always began in the same way, by the
reading of the minutes of the last meeting.&#160; After
that the entertainment varied according to whether
the members happened to be fertile or not in ideas
for the disturbing of the peace.</p>

<p>To-day they were in very fair form.</p>

<p>As soon as Mr. Downing had closed
the minute-book, Wilson, of the School House, held
up his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Wilson?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir, couldn&#8217;t we have a uniform
for the Brigade?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A uniform?&#8221; Mr. Downing pondered</p>

<p>&#8220;Red, with green stripes, sir,&#8221;</p>

<p>Red, with a thin green stripe, was the Sedleigh colour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I put it to the vote, sir?&#8221; asked
Stone.</p>

<p>&#8220;One moment, Stone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those in favour of the motion
move to the left, those against it to the right.&#8221;</p>

<p>A scuffling of feet, a slamming of
desk-lids and an upset blackboard, and the meeting
had divided.</p>

<p>Mr. Downing rapped irritably on his desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down!&#8221; he said, &#8220;sit
down!&#160; I won&#8217;t have this noise and disturbance.&#160;
Stone, sit down&#8212;&#173;Wilson, get back to your
place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir, the motion is carried by twenty-five
votes to six.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir, may I go and get measured this
evening?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Si-<i>lence</i>!&#160; The idea
of a uniform is, of course, out of the question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oo-oo-oo-oo, sir-r-r!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be <i>quiet!</i> Entirely out
of the question.&#160; We cannot plunge into needless
expense.&#160; Stone, listen to me.&#160; I cannot have
this noise and disturbance!&#160; Another time when
a point arises it must be settled by a show of hands.&#160;
Well, Wilson?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir, may we have helmets?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very useful as a protection
against falling timbers, sir,&#8221; said Robinson.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think my people
would be pleased, sir, if they knew I was going out
to fires without a helmet,&#8221; said Stone.</p>

<p>The whole strength of the company:&#160;
&#8220;Please, sir, may we have helmets?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those in favour&#8212;&#173;&#8221; began Stone.</p>

<p>Mr. Downing banged on his desk.&#160;
&#8220;Silence!&#160; Silence!!&#160; Silence!!!&#160;
Helmets are, of course, perfectly preposterous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oo-oo-oo-oo, sir-r-r!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, sir, the danger!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir, the falling timbers!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Fire Brigade had been in action
once and once only in the memory of man, and that
time it was a haystack which had burnt itself out
just as the rescuers had succeeded in fastening the
hose to the hydrant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, please, sir, couldn&#8217;t
we have an honour cap?&#160; It wouldn&#8217;t be expensive,
and it would be just as good as a helmet for all the
timbers that are likely to fall on our heads.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downing smiled a wry smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our Wilson is facetious,&#8221; he remarked
frostily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir, no, sir!&#160; I wasn&#8217;t
facetious!&#160; Or couldn&#8217;t we have footer-tops,
like the first fifteen have?&#160; They&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wilson, leave the room!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir, <i>please</i>, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This moment, Wilson.&#160; And,&#8221;
as he reached the door, &#8220;do me one hundred lines.&#8221;</p>

<p>A pained &#8220;OO-oo-oo, sir-r-r,&#8221; was cut
off by the closing door.</p>

<p>Mr. Downing proceeded to improve the
occasion.&#160; &#8220;I deplore this growing spirit
of flippancy,&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;I tell you
I deplore it!&#160; It is not right!&#160; If this Fire
Brigade is to be of solid use, there must be less
of this flippancy.&#160; We must have keenness.&#160;
I want you boys above all to be keen.&#160; I&#8212;&#173;What
is that noise?&#8221;</p>

<p>From the other side of the door proceeded
a sound like water gurgling from a bottle, mingled
with cries half-suppressed, as if somebody were being
prevented from uttering them by a hand laid over his
mouth.&#160; The sufferer appeared to have a high voice.</p>

<p>There was a tap at the door and Mike
walked in.&#160; He was not alone.&#160; Those near
enough to see, saw that he was accompanied by Jellicoe&#8217;s
clock-work rat, which moved rapidly over the floor
in the direction of the opposite wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I fetch a book from my desk, sir?&#8221;
asked Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well&#8212;&#173;be quick, Jackson; we
are busy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Being interrupted in one of his addresses
to the Brigade irritated Mr. Downing.</p>

<p>The muffled cries grew more distinct.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8212;&#173;is&#8212;&#173;that&#8212;&#173;noise?&#8221;
shrilled Mr. Downing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Noise, sir?&#8221; asked Mike, puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s something
outside the window, sir,&#8221; said Stone helpfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;A bird, I think, sir,&#8221; said Robinson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be absurd!&#8221;
snapped Mr. Downing.&#160; &#8220;It&#8217;s outside
the door.&#160; Wilson!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir?&#8221; said a voice &#8220;off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you making that whining noise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whining noise, sir?&#160; No, sir, I&#8217;m
not making a whining noise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>sort</i> of noise,
sir?&#8221; inquired Mike, as many Wrykynians had
asked before him.&#160; It was a question invented by
Wrykyn for use in just such a case as this.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not propose,&#8221; said
Mr. Downing acidly, &#8220;to imitate the noise; you
can all hear it perfectly plainly.&#160; It is a curious
whining noise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are mowing the cricket
field, sir,&#8221; said the invisible Wilson.&#160;
&#8220;Perhaps that&#8217;s it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be one of the desks
squeaking, sir,&#8221; put in Stone.&#160; &#8220;They
do sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or somebody&#8217;s boots, sir,&#8221; added
Robinson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence!&#160; Wilson?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir?&#8221; bellowed the unseen one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t shout at me from the corridor like
that.&#160; Come in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke the muffled whining changed
suddenly to a series of tenor shrieks, and the india-rubber
form of Sammy bounded into the room like an excited
kangaroo.</p>

<p>Willing hands had by this time deflected
the clockwork rat from the wall to which it had been
steering, and pointed it up the alley-way between
the two rows of desks.&#160; Mr. Downing, rising from
his place, was just in time to see Sammy with a last
leap spring on his prey and begin worrying it.</p>

<p>Chaos reigned.</p>

<p>&#8220;A rat!&#8221; shouted Robinson.</p>

<p>The twenty-three members of the Brigade
who were not earnest instantly dealt with the situation,
each in the manner that seemed proper to him.&#160;
Some leaped on to forms, others flung books, all shouted.&#160;
It was a stirring, bustling scene.</p>

<p>Sammy had by this time disposed of
the clock-work rat, and was now standing, like Marius,
among the ruins barking triumphantly.</p>

<p>The banging on Mr. Downing&#8217;s
desk resembled thunder.&#160; It rose above all the
other noises till in time they gave up the competition
and died away.</p>

<p>Mr. Downing shot out orders, threats,
and penalties with the rapidity of a Maxim gun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stone, sit down!&#160; Donovan,
if you do not sit down, you will be severely punished.&#160;
Henderson, one hundred lines for gross disorder!&#160;
Windham, the same!&#160; Go to your seat, Vincent.&#160;
What are you doing, Broughton-Knight?&#160; I will
not have this disgraceful noise and disorder!&#160;
The meeting is at an end; go quietly from the room,
all of you.&#160; Jackson and Wilson, remain. <i>Quietly</i>,
I said, Durand!&#160; Don&#8217;t shuffle your feet
in that abominable way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crash!</p>

<p>&#8220;Wolferstan, I distinctly saw
you upset that black-board with a movement of your
hand&#8212;&#173;one hundred lines.&#160; Go quietly
from the room, everybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>The meeting dispersed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jackson and Wilson, come here.&#160;
What&#8217;s the meaning of this disgraceful conduct?&#160;
Put that dog out of the room, Jackson.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike removed the yelling Sammy and
shut the door on him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Wilson?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir, I was playing with a clock-work
rat&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What business have you to be playing with clock-work
rats?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I remembered,&#8221; said
Mike, &#8220;that I had left my Horace in my desk,
so I came in&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And by a fluke, sir,&#8221;
said Wilson, as one who tells of strange things, &#8220;the
rat happened to be pointing in the same direction,
so he came in, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I met Sammy on the gravel outside and he followed
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tried to collar him, but
when you told me to come in, sir, I had to let him
go, and he came in after the rat.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was plain to Mr. Downing that the
burden of sin was shared equally by both culprits.&#160;
Wilson had supplied the rat, Mike the dog; but Mr.
Downing liked Wilson and disliked Mike.&#160; Wilson
was in the Fire Brigade, frivolous at times, it was
true, but nevertheless a member.&#160; Also he kept
wicket for the school.&#160; Mike was a member of the
Archaeological Society, and had refused to play cricket.</p>

<p>Mr. Downing allowed these facts to
influence him in passing sentence.</p>

<p>&#8220;One hundred lines, Wilson,&#8221; he said.&#160;
&#8220;You may go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wilson departed with the air of a
man who has had a great deal of fun, and paid very
little for it.</p>

<p>Mr. Downing turned to Mike.&#160; &#8220;You
will stay in on Saturday afternoon, Jackson; it will
interfere with your Archaeological studies, I fear,
but it may teach you that we have no room at Sedleigh
for boys who spend their time loafing about and making
themselves a nuisance.&#160; We are a keen school;
this is no place for boys who do nothing but waste
their time.&#160; That will do, Jackson.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Mr. Downing walked out of the
room.&#160; In affairs of this kind a master has a
habit of getting the last word.</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch39">
CHAPTER XXXIX<br><br>
ACHILLES LEAVES HIS TENT</a></h3>

<p>They say misfortunes never come singly.&#160;
As Mike sat brooding over his wrongs in his study,
after the Sammy incident, Jellicoe came into the room,
and, without preamble, asked for the loan of a sovereign.</p>

<p>When one has been in the habit of
confining one&#8217;s lendings and borrowings to sixpences
and shillings, a request for a sovereign comes as
something of a blow.</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth for?&#8221; asked Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, do you mind if I don&#8217;t
tell you?&#160; I don&#8217;t want to tell anybody.&#160;
The fact is, I&#8217;m in a beastly hole.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, sorry,&#8221; said Mike.&#160;
&#8220;As a matter of fact, I do happen to have a
quid.&#160; You can freeze on to it, if you like.&#160;
But it&#8217;s about all I have got, so don&#8217;t
be shy about paying it back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jellicoe was profuse in his thanks,
and disappeared in a cloud of gratitude.</p>

<p>Mike felt that Fate was treating him
badly.&#160; Being kept in on Saturday meant that he
would be unable to turn out for Little Borlock against
Claythorpe, the return match.&#160; In the previous
game he had scored ninety-eight, and there was a lob
bowler in the Claythorpe ranks whom he was particularly
anxious to meet again.&#160; Having to yield a sovereign
to Jellicoe&#8212;&#173;why on earth did the man want
all that?&#8212;&#173;meant that, unless a carefully
worded letter to his brother Bob at Oxford had the
desired effect, he would be practically penniless for
weeks.</p>

<p>In a gloomy frame of mind he sat down
to write to Bob, who was playing regularly for the
&#8217;Varsity this season, and only the previous week
had made a century against Sussex, so might be expected
to be in a sufficiently softened mood to advance the
needful. (Which, it may be stated at once, he did,
by return of post.)</p>

<p>Mike was struggling with the opening
sentences of this letter&#8212;&#173;he was never a
very ready writer&#8212;&#173;when Stone and Robinson
burst into the room.</p>

<p>Mike put down his pen, and got up.&#160;
He was in warlike mood, and welcomed the intrusion.&#160;
If Stone and Robinson wanted battle, they should have
it.</p>

<p>But the motives of the expedition
were obviously friendly.&#160; Stone beamed.&#160; Robinson
was laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a sportsman,&#8221; said Robinson.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he give you?&#8221; asked Stone.</p>

<p>They sat down, Robinson on the table,
Stone in Psmith&#8217;s deck-chair.&#160; Mike&#8217;s
heart warmed to them.&#160; The little disturbance in
the dormitory was a thing of the past, done with,
forgotten, contemporary with Julius Caesar.&#160; He
felt that he, Stone and Robinson must learn to know
and appreciate one another.</p>

<p>There was, as a matter of fact, nothing
much wrong with Stone and Robinson.&#160; They were
just ordinary raggers of the type found at every public
school, small and large.&#160; They were absolutely
free from brain.&#160; They had a certain amount of
muscle, and a vast store of animal spirits.&#160; They
looked on school life purely as a vehicle for ragging.&#160;
The Stones and Robinsons are the swashbucklers of the
school world.&#160; They go about, loud and boisterous,
with a whole-hearted and cheerful indifference to
other people&#8217;s feelings, treading on the toes
of their neighbour and shoving him off the pavement,
and always with an eye wide open for any adventure.&#160;
As to the kind of adventure, they are not particular
so long as it promises excitement.&#160; Sometimes they
go through their whole school career without accident.&#160;
More often they run up against a snag in the shape
of some serious-minded and muscular person who objects
to having his toes trodden on and being shoved off
the pavement, and then they usually sober down, to
the mutual advantage of themselves and the rest of
the community.</p>

<p>One&#8217;s opinion of this type of
youth varies according to one&#8217;s point of view.&#160;
Small boys whom they had occasion to kick, either from
pure high spirits or as a punishment for some slip
from the narrow path which the ideal small boy should
tread, regarded Stone and Robinson as bullies of the
genuine &#8220;Eric&#8221; and &#8220;St. Winifred&#8217;s&#8221;
brand.&#160; Masters were rather afraid of them.&#160;
Adair had a smouldering dislike for them.&#160; They
were useful at cricket, but apt not to take Sedleigh
as seriously as he could have wished.</p>

<p>As for Mike, he now found them pleasant
company, and began to get out the tea-things.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those Fire Brigade meetings,&#8221;
said Stone, &#8220;are a rag.&#160; You can do what
you like, and you never get more than a hundred lines.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you!&#8221; said Mike.&#160; &#8220;I
got Saturday afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Wilson in too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#160; He got a hundred lines.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stone and Robinson were quite concerned.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a beastly swindle!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because you don&#8217;t
play cricket.&#160; Old Downing lets you do what you
like if you join the Fire Brigade and play cricket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;We are, above all, a
keen school,&#8217;&#8221; quoted Stone.&#160; &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you ever play?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have played a bit,&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t you have
a shot?&#160; We aren&#8217;t such flyers here.&#160;
If you know one end of a bat from the other, you could
get into some sort of a team.&#160; Were you at school
anywhere before you came here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was at Wrykyn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why on earth did you leave?&#8221; asked Stone.&#160;
&#8220;Were you sacked?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#160; My pater took me away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wrykyn?&#8221; said Robinson.&#160;
&#8220;Are you any relation of the Jacksons there&#8212;&#173;J.&#160;
W. and the others?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, didn&#8217;t you play at all there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mike, &#8220;I
did.&#160; I was in the team three years, and I should
have been captain this year, if I&#8217;d stopped on.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a profound and gratifying sensation.&#160;
Stone gaped, and Robinson nearly dropped his tea-cup.</p>

<p>Stone broke the silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I mean to say&#8212;&#173;look
here!&#160; What I mean is, why aren&#8217;t you playing?&#160;
Why don&#8217;t you play now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do.&#160; I play for a village
near here.&#160; Place called Little Borlock.&#160; A
man who played against Wrykyn for the Free Foresters
captains them.&#160; He asked me if I&#8217;d like
some games for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why not for the school?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I?&#160; It&#8217;s
much better fun for the village.&#160; You don&#8217;t
get ordered about by Adair, for a start.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Adair sticks on side,&#8221; said Stone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough for six,&#8221; agreed Robinson.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove,&#8221; said Stone, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got an idea.&#160; My word, what a rag!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong now?&#8221; inquired Mike
politely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, look here.&#160; To-morrow&#8217;s
Mid-term Service day.&#160; It&#8217;s nowhere near
the middle of the term, but they always have it in
the fourth week.&#160; There&#8217;s chapel at half-past
nine till half-past ten.&#160; Then the rest of the
day&#8217;s a whole holiday.&#160; There are always
house matches.&#160; We&#8217;re playing Downing&#8217;s.&#160;
Why don&#8217;t you play and let&#8217;s smash them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, yes,&#8221; said Robinson.&#160;
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you?&#160; They&#8217;re always
sticking on side because they&#8217;ve won the house
cup three years running.&#160; I say, do you bat or
bowl?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bat.&#160; Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>Robinson rocked on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, old Downing fancies himself
as a bowler.&#160; You <i>must</i> play, and knock
the cover off him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Masters don&#8217;t play in house matches,
surely?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t a real house
match.&#160; Only a friendly.&#160; Downing always turns
out on Mid-term Service day.&#160; I say, do play.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Think of the rag.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the team&#8217;s full,&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;The list isn&#8217;t up yet.&#160;
We&#8217;ll nip across to Barnes&#8217; study, and
make him alter it.&#8221;</p>

<p>They dashed out of the room.&#160;
From down the passage Mike heard yells of &#8220;<i>Barnes</i>!&#8221;
the closing of a door, and a murmur of excited conversation.&#160;
Then footsteps returning down the passage.</p>

<p>Barnes appeared, on his face the look
of one who has seen visions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is
it true?&#160; Or is Stone rotting?&#160; About Wrykyn,
I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I was in the team.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes was an enthusiastic cricketer.&#160;
He studied his <i>Wisden</i>, and he had an immense
respect for Wrykyn cricket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you the M. Jackson, then,
who had an average of fifty-one point nought three
last year?&#8221;</p>

<center><a name="illus1">
<img src="images/jmike1.jpg" alt="&#8220;ARE YOU THE M. JACKSON, THEN, WHO HAD AN AVERAGE OF FIFTY-ONE POINT NOUGHT THREE LAST YEAR?&#8221;">
</a></center>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes&#8217;s manner became like that of a curate
talking to a bishop.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; he said, &#8220;then&#8212;&#173;er&#8212;&#173;will
you play against Downing&#8217;s to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather,&#8221; said Mike.&#160; &#8220;Thanks
awfully.&#160; Have some tea?&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch40">
CHAPTER XL<br><br>
THE MATCH WITH DOWNING&#8217;S</a></h3>

<p>It is the curious instinct which prompts
most people to rub a thing in that makes the lot of
the average convert an unhappy one.&#160; Only the
very self-controlled can refrain from improving the
occasion and scoring off the convert.&#160; Most leap
at the opportunity.</p>

<p>It was so in Mike&#8217;s case.&#160;
Mike was not a genuine convert, but to Mr. Downing
he had the outward aspect of one.&#160; When you have
been impressing upon a non-cricketing boy for nearly
a month that (<i>a</i>) the school is above all a
keen school, (<i>b</i>) that all members of it should
play cricket, and (<i>c</i>) that by not playing cricket
he is ruining his chances in this world and imperilling
them in the next; and when, quite unexpectedly, you
come upon this boy dressed in cricket flannels, wearing
cricket boots and carrying a cricket bag, it seems
only natural to assume that you have converted him,
that the seeds of your eloquence have fallen on fruitful
soil and sprouted.</p>

<p>Mr. Downing assumed it.</p>

<p>He was walking to the field with Adair
and another member of his team when he came upon Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; he cried.&#160;
&#8220;Our Jackson clad in suit of mail and armed for
the fray!&#8221;</p>

<p>This was Mr. Downing&#8217;s No. 2 manner&#8212;&#173;the
playful.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is indeed Saul among the
prophets.&#160; Why this sudden enthusiasm for a game
which I understood that you despised?&#160; Are our
opponents so reduced?&#8221;</p>

<p>Psmith, who was with Mike, took charge
of the affair with a languid grace which had maddened
hundreds in its time, and which never failed to ruffle
Mr. Downing.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are, above all, sir,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;a keen house.&#160; Drones are not
welcomed by us.&#160; We are essentially versatile.&#160;
Jackson, the archaeologist of yesterday, becomes the
cricketer of to-day.&#160; It is the right spirit,
sir,&#8221; said Psmith earnestly.&#160; &#8220;I like
to see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, Smith?&#160; You are
not playing yourself, I notice.&#160; Your enthusiasm
has bounds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In our house, sir, competition
is fierce, and the Selection Committee unfortunately
passed me over.&#8221;</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>There were a number of pitches dotted
about over the field, for there was always a touch
of the London Park about it on Mid-term Service day.&#160;
Adair, as captain of cricket, had naturally selected
the best for his own match.&#160; It was a good wicket,
Mike saw.&#160; As a matter of fact the wickets at
Sedleigh were nearly always good.&#160; Adair had infected
the ground-man with some of his own keenness, with
the result that that once-leisurely official now found
himself sometimes, with a kind of mild surprise, working
really hard.&#160; At the beginning of the previous
season Sedleigh had played a scratch team from a neighbouring
town on a wicket which, except for the creases, was
absolutely undistinguishable from the surrounding
turf, and behind the pavilion after the match Adair
had spoken certain home truths to the ground-man.&#160;
The latter&#8217;s reformation had dated from that
moment.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>Barnes, timidly jubilant, came up
to Mike with the news that he had won the toss, and
the request that Mike would go in first with him.</p>

<p>In stories of the &#8220;Not Really
a Duffer&#8221; type, where the nervous new boy, who
has been found crying in the boot-room over the photograph
of his sister, contrives to get an innings in a game,
nobody suspects that he is really a prodigy till he
hits the Bully&#8217;s first ball out of the ground
for six.</p>

<p>With Mike it was different.&#160; There
was no pitying smile on Adair&#8217;s face as he started
his run preparatory to sending down the first ball.&#160;
Mike, on the cricket field, could not have looked anything
but a cricketer if he had turned out in a tweed suit
and hobnail boots.&#160; Cricketer was written all
over him&#8212;&#173;in his walk, in the way he took
guard, in his stand at the wickets.&#160; Adair started
to bowl with the feeling that this was somebody who
had more than a little knowledge of how to deal with
good bowling and punish bad.</p>

<p>Mike started cautiously.&#160; He was
more than usually anxious to make runs to-day, and
he meant to take no risks till he could afford to do
so.&#160; He had seen Adair bowl at the nets, and he
knew that he was good.</p>

<p>The first over was a maiden, six dangerous
balls beautifully played.&#160; The fieldsmen changed
over.</p>

<p>The general interest had now settled
on the match between Outwood&#8217;s and Downing&#8217;s.&#160;
The fact in Mike&#8217;s case had gone round the field,
and, as several of the other games had not yet begun,
quite a large crowd had collected near the pavilion
to watch.&#160; Mike&#8217;s masterly treatment of
the opening over had impressed the spectators, and
there was a popular desire to see how he would deal
with Mr. Downing&#8217;s slows.&#160; It was generally
anticipated that he would do something special with
them.</p>

<p>Off the first ball of the master&#8217;s
over a leg-bye was run.</p>

<p>Mike took guard.</p>

<p>Mr. Downing was a bowler with a style
of his own.&#160; He took two short steps, two long
steps, gave a jump, took three more short steps, and
ended with a combination of step and jump, during which
the ball emerged from behind his back and started
on its slow career to the wicket.&#160; The whole business
had some of the dignity of the old-fashioned minuet,
subtly blended with the careless vigour of a cake-walk.&#160;
The ball, when delivered, was billed to break from
leg, but the programme was subject to alterations.</p>

<p>If the spectators had expected Mike
to begin any firework effects with the first ball,
they were disappointed.&#160; He played the over through
with a grace worthy of his brother Joe.&#160; The last
ball he turned to leg for a single.</p>

<p>His treatment of Adair&#8217;s next
over was freer.&#160; He had got a sight of the ball
now.&#160; Half-way through the over a beautiful square
cut forced a passage through the crowd by the pavilion,
and dashed up against the rails.&#160; He drove the
sixth ball past cover for three.</p>

<p>The crowd was now reluctantly dispersing
to its own games, but it stopped as Mr. Downing started
his minuet-cake-walk, in the hope that it might see
something more sensational.</p>

<p>This time the hope was fulfilled.</p>

<p>The ball was well up, slow, and off
the wicket on the on-side.&#160; Perhaps if it had
been allowed to pitch, it might have broken in and
become quite dangerous.&#160; Mike went out at it,
and hit it a couple of feet from the ground.&#160;
The ball dropped with a thud and a spurting of dust
in the road that ran along one side of the cricket
field.</p>

<p>It was returned on the instalment
system by helpers from other games, and the bowler
began his manoeuvres again.&#160; A half-volley this
time.&#160; Mike slammed it back, and mid-on, whose
heart was obviously not in the thing, failed to stop
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get to them, Jenkins,&#8221;
said Mr. Downing irritably, as the ball came back
from the boundary.&#160; &#8220;Get to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir, please, sir&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk in the field, Jenkins.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having had a full-pitch hit for six
and a half-volley for four, there was a strong probability
that Mr. Downing would pitch his next ball short.</p>

<p>The expected happened.&#160; The third
ball was a slow long-hop, and hit the road at about
the same spot where the first had landed.&#160; A howl
of untuneful applause rose from the watchers in the
pavilion, and Mike, with the feeling that this sort
of bowling was too good to be true, waited in position
for number four.</p>

<p>There are moments when a sort of panic
seizes a bowler.&#160; This happened now with Mr. Downing.&#160;
He suddenly abandoned science and ran amok.&#160; His
run lost its stateliness and increased its vigour.&#160;
He charged up to the wicket as a wounded buffalo sometimes
charges a gun.&#160; His whole idea now was to bowl
fast.</p>

<p>When a slow bowler starts to bowl
fast, it is usually as well to be batting, if you
can manage it.</p>

<p>By the time the over was finished,
Mike&#8217;s score had been increased by sixteen,
and the total of his side, in addition, by three wides.</p>

<p>And a shrill small voice, from the
neighbourhood of the pavilion, uttered with painful
distinctness the words, &#8220;Take him off!&#8221;</p>

<p>That was how the most sensational
day&#8217;s cricket began that Sedleigh had known.</p>

<p>A description of the details of the
morning&#8217;s play would be monotonous.&#160; It
is enough to say that they ran on much the same lines
as the third and fourth overs of the match.&#160; Mr.
Downing bowled one more over, off which Mike helped
himself to sixteen runs, and then retired moodily
to cover-point, where, in Adair&#8217;s fifth over,
he missed Barnes&#8212;&#173;the first occasion since
the game began on which that mild batsman had attempted
to score more than a single.&#160; Scared by this escape,
Outwood&#8217;s captain shrank back into his shell,
sat on the splice like a limpet, and, offering no
more chances, was not out at lunch time with a score
of eleven.</p>

<p>Mike had then made a hundred and three.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>As Mike was taking off his pads in
the pavilion, Adair came up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you say you didn&#8217;t
play cricket?&#8221; he asked abruptly.</p>

<center><a name="illus9">
<img src="images/jmike9.jpg" alt="&#8220;WHY DID YOU SAY YOU DIDN&#8217;T PLAY CRICKET?&#8221; HE ASKED">
</a></center>

<p>When one has been bowling the whole
morning, and bowling well, without the slightest success,
one is inclined to be abrupt.</p>

<p>Mike finished unfastening an obstinate
strap.&#160; Then he looked up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say anything
of the kind.&#160; I said I wasn&#8217;t going to play
here.&#160; There&#8217;s a difference.&#160; As a matter
of fact, I was in the Wrykyn team before I came here.&#160;
Three years.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adair was silent for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you play for us against
the Old Sedleighans to-morrow?&#8221; he said at length.</p>

<p>Mike tossed his pads into his bag and got up.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thanks.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Above it, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit.&#160; Not up to it.&#160;
I shall want a lot of coaching at that end net of
yours before I&#8217;m fit to play for Sedleigh.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was another pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you won&#8217;t play?&#8221; asked Adair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not keeping you, am I?&#8221; said
Mike, politely.</p>

<p>It was remarkable what a number of
members of Outwood&#8217;s house appeared to cherish
a personal grudge against Mr. Downing.&#160; It had
been that master&#8217;s somewhat injudicious practice
for many years to treat his own house as a sort of
Chosen People.&#160; Of all masters, the most unpopular
is he who by the silent tribunal of a school is convicted
of favouritism.&#160; And the dislike deepens if it
is a house which he favours and not merely individuals.&#160;
On occasions when boys in his own house and boys from
other houses were accomplices and partners in wrong-doing,
Mr. Downing distributed his thunderbolts unequally,
and the school noticed it.&#160; The result was that
not only he himself, but also&#8212;&#173;which was
rather unfair&#8212;&#173;his house, too, had acquired
a good deal of unpopularity.</p>

<p>The general consensus of opinion in
Outwood&#8217;s during the luncheon interval was that,
having got Downing&#8217;s up a tree, they would be
fools not to make the most of the situation.</p>

<p>Barnes&#8217;s remark that he supposed,
unless anything happened and wickets began to fall
a bit faster, they had better think of declaring somewhere
about half-past three or four, was met with a storm
of opposition.</p>

<p>&#8220;Declare!&#8221; said Robinson.&#160;
&#8220;Great Scott, what on earth are you talking
about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Declare!&#8221; Stone&#8217;s
voice was almost a wail of indignation.&#160; &#8220;I
never saw such a chump.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be rather sick
if we don&#8217;t, won&#8217;t they?&#8221; suggested
Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sick!&#160; I should think they
would,&#8221; said Stone.&#160; &#8220;That&#8217;s
just the gay idea.&#160; Can&#8217;t you see that by
a miracle we&#8217;ve got a chance of getting a jolly
good bit of our own back against those Downing&#8217;s
ticks?&#160; What we&#8217;ve got to do is to jolly
well keep them in the field all day if we can, and
be jolly glad it&#8217;s so beastly hot.&#160; If they
lose about a dozen pounds each through sweating about
in the sun after Jackson&#8217;s drives, perhaps they&#8217;ll
stick on less side about things in general in future.&#160;
Besides, I want an innings against that bilge of old
Downing&#8217;s, if I can get it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; said Robinson.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you declare, I swear I won&#8217;t field.&#160;
Nor will Robinson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I won&#8217;t then,&#8221;
said Barnes unhappily.&#160; &#8220;Only you know they&#8217;re
rather sick already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry about
that,&#8221; said Stone with a wide grin.&#160; &#8220;They&#8217;ll
be a lot sicker before we&#8217;ve finished.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so it came about that that particular
Mid-term Service-day match made history.&#160; Big
scores had often been put up on Mid-term Service day.&#160;
Games had frequently been one-sided.&#160; But it had
never happened before in the annals of the school
that one side, going in first early in the morning,
had neither completed its innings nor declared it
closed when stumps were drawn at 6.30.&#160; In no previous
Sedleigh match, after a full day&#8217;s play, had
the pathetic words &#8220;Did not bat&#8221; been
written against the whole of one of the contending
teams.</p>

<p>These are the things which mark epochs.</p>

<p>Play was resumed at 2.15.&#160; For
a quarter of an hour Mike was comparatively quiet.&#160;
Adair, fortified by food and rest, was bowling really
well, and his first half-dozen overs had to be watched
carefully.&#160; But the wicket was too good to give
him a chance, and Mike, playing himself in again,
proceeded to get to business once more.&#160; Bowlers
came and went.&#160; Adair pounded away at one end with
brief intervals between the attacks.&#160; Mr. Downing
took a couple more overs, in one of which a horse,
passing in the road, nearly had its useful life cut
suddenly short.&#160; Change-bowlers of various actions
and paces, each weirder and more futile than the last,
tried their luck.&#160; But still the first-wicket
stand continued.</p>

<p>The bowling of a house team is all
head and no body.&#160; The first pair probably have
some idea of length and break.&#160; The first-change
pair are poor.&#160; And the rest, the small change,
are simply the sort of things one sees in dreams after
a heavy supper, or when one is out without one&#8217;s
gun.</p>

<p>Time, mercifully, generally breaks
up a big stand at cricket before the field has suffered
too much, and that is what happened now.&#160; At four
o&#8217;clock, when the score stood at two hundred
and twenty for no wicket, Barnes, greatly daring,
smote lustily at a rather wide half-volley and was
caught at short-slip for thirty-three.&#160; He retired
blushfully to the pavilion, amidst applause, and Stone
came out.</p>

<p>As Mike had then made a hundred and
eighty-seven, it was assumed by the field, that directly
he had topped his second century, the closure would
be applied and their ordeal finished.&#160; There was
almost a sigh of relief when frantic cheering from
the crowd told that the feat had been accomplished.&#160;
The fieldsmen clapped in quite an indulgent sort of
way, as who should say, &#8220;Capital, capital.&#160;
And now let&#8217;s start <i>our</i> innings.&#8221;&#160;
Some even began to edge towards the pavilion.&#160;
But the next ball was bowled, and the next over, and
the next after that, and still Barnes made no sign.
(The conscience-stricken captain of Outwood&#8217;s
was, as a matter of fact, being practically held down
by Robinson and other ruffians by force.)</p>

<p>A grey dismay settled on the field.</p>

<p>The bowling had now become almost
unbelievably bad.&#160; Lobs were being tried, and
Stone, nearly weeping with pure joy, was playing an
innings of the How-to-brighten-cricket type.&#160;
He had an unorthodox style, but an excellent eye,
and the road at this period of the game became absolutely
unsafe for pedestrians and traffic.</p>

<p>Mike&#8217;s pace had become slower,
as was only natural, but his score, too, was mounting
steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is foolery,&#8221; snapped
Mr. Downing, as the three hundred and fifty went up
on the board.&#160; &#8220;Barnes!&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>There was no reply.&#160; A committee
of three was at that moment engaged in sitting on
Barnes&#8217;s head in the first eleven changing-room,
in order to correct a more than usually feverish attack
of conscience.</p>

<p>&#8220;Barnes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir,&#8221; said Stone,
some species of telepathy telling him what was detaining
his captain.&#160; &#8220;I think Barnes must have left
the field.&#160; He has probably gone over to the house
to fetch something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is absurd.&#160; You must
declare your innings closed.&#160; The game has become
a farce.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Declare!&#160; Sir, we can&#8217;t
unless Barnes does.&#160; He might be awfully annoyed
if we did anything like that without consulting him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absurd.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s very touchy, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is perfect foolery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think Jenkins is just going to bowl, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downing walked moodily to his place.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>In a neat wooden frame in the senior
day-room at Outwood&#8217;s, just above the mantelpiece,

CHAPTER XLI<br><br>
THE SINGULAR BEHAVIOUR OF JELLICOE</a></h3>

<p>Outwood&#8217;s rollicked considerably
that night.&#160; Mike, if he had cared to take the
part, could have been the Petted Hero.&#160; But a cordial
invitation from the senior day-room to be the guest
of the evening at about the biggest rag of the century
had been refused on the plea of fatigue.&#160; One
does not make two hundred and seventy-seven runs on
a hot day without feeling the effects, even if one
has scored mainly by the medium of boundaries; and
Mike, as he lay back in Psmith&#8217;s deck-chair,
felt that all he wanted was to go to bed and stay there
for a week.&#160; His hands and arms burned as if they
were red-hot, and his eyes were so tired that he could
not keep them open.</p>

<p>Psmith, leaning against the mantelpiece,
discoursed in a desultory way on the day&#8217;s happenings&#8212;&#173;the
score off Mr. Downing, the undeniable annoyance of
that battered bowler, and the probability of his venting
his annoyance on Mike next day.</p>

<p>&#8220;In theory,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;the manly what-d&#8217;you-call-it of cricket
and all that sort of thing ought to make him fall
on your neck to-morrow and weep over you as a foeman
worthy of his steel.&#160; But I am prepared to bet
a reasonable sum that he will give no Jiu-jitsu exhibition
of this kind.&#160; In fact, from what I have seen
of our bright little friend, I should say that, in
a small way, he will do his best to make it distinctly
hot for you, here and there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221;
murmured Mike, shifting his aching limbs in the chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;In an ordinary way, I suppose,
a man can put up with having his bowling hit a little.&#160;
But your performance was cruelty to animals.&#160;
Twenty-eight off one over, not to mention three wides,
would have made Job foam at the mouth.&#160; You will
probably get sacked.&#160; On the other hand, it&#8217;s
worth it.&#160; You have lit a candle this day which
can never be blown out.&#160; You have shown the lads
of the village how Comrade Downing&#8217;s bowling
ought to be treated.&#160; I don&#8217;t suppose he&#8217;ll
ever take another wicket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t deserve to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Psmith smoothed his hair at the glass and turned round
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;The only blot on this day of
mirth and good-will is,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the
singular conduct of our friend Jellicoe.&#160; When
all the place was ringing with song and merriment,
Comrade Jellicoe crept to my side, and, slipping his
little hand in mine, touched me for three quid.&#8221;</p>

<p>This interested Mike, fagged as he was.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#160; Three quid!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Three jingling, clinking sovereigns.&#160; He
wanted four.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the man must be living
at the rate of I don&#8217;t know what.&#160; It was
only yesterday that he borrowed a quid from <i>me</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must be saving money fast.&#160;
There appear to be the makings of a financier about
Comrade Jellicoe.&#160; Well, I hope, when he&#8217;s
collected enough for his needs, he&#8217;ll pay me
back a bit.&#160; I&#8217;m pretty well cleaned out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I got some from my brother at Oxford.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he&#8217;s saving up
to get married.&#160; We may be helping towards furnishing
the home.&#160; There was a Siamese prince fellow at
my dame&#8217;s at Eton who had four wives when he
arrived, and gathered in a fifth during his first
summer holidays.&#160; It was done on the correspondence
system.&#160; His Prime Minister fixed it up at the
other end, and sent him the glad news on a picture
post-card.&#160; I think an eye ought to be kept on
Comrade Jellicoe.&#8221;</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>Mike tumbled into bed that night like
a log, but he could not sleep.&#160; He ached all over.&#160;
Psmith chatted for a time on human affairs in general,
and then dropped gently off.&#160; Jellicoe, who appeared
to be wrapped in gloom, contributed nothing to the
conversation.</p>

<p>After Psmith had gone to sleep, Mike
lay for some time running over in his mind, as the
best substitute for sleep, the various points of his
innings that day.&#160; He felt very hot and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Just as he was wondering whether it
would not be a good idea to get up and have a cold
bath, a voice spoke from the darkness at his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you asleep, Jackson?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me&#8212;&#173;Jellicoe.&#160; I can&#8217;t
get to sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor can I. I&#8217;m stiff all over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come over and sit on your bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a creaking, and then a weight
descended in the neighbourhood of Mike&#8217;s toes.</p>

<p>Jellicoe was apparently not in conversational
mood.&#160; He uttered no word for quite three minutes.&#160;
At the end of which time he gave a sound midway between
a snort and a sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Jackson!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you&#8212;&#173;oh, nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Silence again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jackson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, what would your people say if you got
sacked?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All sorts of things.&#160; Especially my pater.&#160;
Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know.&#160; So would mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everybody&#8217;s would, I expect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bed creaked, as Jellicoe digested
these great thoughts.&#160; Then he spoke again.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be a jolly beastly thing to get sacked.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike was too tired to give his mind
to the subject.&#160; He was not really listening.&#160;
Jellicoe droned on in a depressed sort of way.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d get home in the
middle of the afternoon, I suppose, and you&#8217;d
drive up to the house, and the servant would open the
door, and you&#8217;d go in.&#160; They might all be
out, and then you&#8217;d have to hang about, and
wait; and presently you&#8217;d hear them come in,
and you&#8217;d go out into the passage, and they&#8217;d
say &#8216;Hullo!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Jellicoe, in order to give verisimilitude,
as it were, to an otherwise bald and unconvincing
narrative, flung so much agitated surprise into the
last word that it woke Mike from a troubled doze into
which he had fallen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo?&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;What&#8217;s
up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;d say.&#160;
&#8216;Hullo!&#8217; And then they&#8217;d say, &#8217;What
are you doing here?&#160; &#8217;And you&#8217;d say&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth are you talking about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About what would happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Happen when?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you got home.&#160; After being sacked,
you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s been sacked?&#8221; Mike&#8217;s
mind was still under a cloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody.&#160; But if you were,
I meant.&#160; And then I suppose there&#8217;d be an
awful row and general sickness, and all that.&#160;
And then you&#8217;d be sent into a bank, or to Australia,
or something.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike dozed off again.</p>

<p>&#8220;My pater would be frightfully
sick.&#160; My mater would be sick.&#160; My sister
would be jolly sick, too.&#160; Have you got any sisters,
Jackson?&#160; I say, Jackson!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo!&#160; What&#8217;s the matter?&#160; Who&#8217;s
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me&#8212;&#173;Jellicoe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked you if you&#8217;d got any sisters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any <i>what</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sisters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whose sisters?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yours.&#160; I asked if you&#8217;d got any.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sisters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about them?&#8221;</p>

<p>The conversation was becoming too
intricate for Jellicoe.&#160; He changed the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Jackson!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, you don&#8217;t know any one who could
lend me a pound, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; cried Mike, sitting
up in bed and staring through the darkness in the
direction whence the numismatist&#8217;s voice was
proceeding.&#160; &#8220;Do <i>what</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, look out.&#160; You&#8217;ll wake Smith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you say you wanted some one to lend you
a quid?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jellicoe eagerly.&#160; &#8220;Do
you know any one?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike&#8217;s head throbbed.&#160; This
thing was too much.&#160; The human brain could not
be expected to cope with it.&#160; Here was a youth
who had borrowed a pound from one friend the day before,
and three pounds from another friend that very afternoon,
already looking about him for further loans.&#160;
Was it a hobby, or was he saving up to buy an aeroplane?</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth do you want a pound for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to tell
anybody.&#160; But it&#8217;s jolly serious.&#160; I
shall get sacked if I don&#8217;t get it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike pondered.</p>

<p>Those who have followed Mike&#8217;s
career as set forth by the present historian will
have realised by this time that he was a good long
way from being perfect.&#160; As the Blue-Eyed Hero
he would have been a rank failure.&#160; Except on
the cricket field, where he was a natural genius,
he was just ordinary.&#160; He resembled ninety per
cent. of other members of English public schools.&#160;
He had some virtues and a good many defects.&#160;
He was as obstinate as a mule, though people whom he
liked could do as they pleased with him.&#160; He was
good-natured as a general thing, but on occasion his
temper could be of the worst, and had, in his childhood,
been the subject of much adverse comment among his
aunts.&#160; He was rigidly truthful, where the issue
concerned only himself.&#160; Where it was a case of
saving a friend, he was prepared to act in a manner
reminiscent of an American expert witness.</p>

<p>He had, in addition, one good quality
without any defect to balance it.&#160; He was always
ready to help people.&#160; And when he set himself
to do this, he was never put off by discomfort or
risk.&#160; He went at the thing with a singleness
of purpose that asked no questions.</p>

<p>Bob&#8217;s postal order, which had
arrived that evening, was reposing in the breast-pocket
of his coat.</p>

<p>It was a wrench, but, if the situation
was so serious with Jellicoe, it had to be done.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>Two minutes later the night was being
made hideous by Jellicoe&#8217;s almost tearful protestations
of gratitude, and the postal order had moved from
one side of the dormitory to the other.</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch42">
CHAPTER XLII<br><br>
JELLICOE GOES ON THE SICK-LIST</a></h3>

<p>Mike woke next morning with a confused
memory of having listened to a great deal of incoherent
conversation from Jellicoe, and a painfully vivid
recollection of handing over the bulk of his worldly
wealth to him.&#160; The thought depressed him, though
it seemed to please Jellicoe, for the latter carolled
in a gay undertone as he dressed, till Psmith, who
had a sensitive ear, asked as a favour that these farm-yard
imitations might cease until he was out of the room.</p>

<p>There were other things to make Mike
low-spirited that morning.&#160; To begin with, he
was in detention, which in itself is enough to spoil
a day.&#160; It was a particularly fine day, which
made the matter worse.&#160; In addition to this, he
had never felt stiffer in his life.&#160; It seemed
to him that the creaking of his joints as he walked
must be audible to every one within a radius of several
yards.&#160; Finally, there was the interview with
Mr. Downing to come.&#160; That would probably be unpleasant.&#160;
As Psmith had said, Mr. Downing was the sort of master
who would be likely to make trouble.&#160; The great
match had not been an ordinary match.&#160; Mr. Downing
was a curious man in many ways, but he did not make
a fuss on ordinary occasions when his bowling proved
expensive.&#160; Yesterday&#8217;s performance, however,
stood in a class by itself.&#160; It stood forth without
disguise as a deliberate rag.&#160; One side does not
keep another in the field the whole day in a one-day
match except as a grisly kind of practical joke.&#160;
And Mr. Downing and his house realised this.&#160;
The house&#8217;s way of signifying its comprehension
of the fact was to be cold and distant as far as the
seniors were concerned, and abusive and pugnacious
as regards the juniors.&#160; Young blood had been
shed overnight, and more flowed during the eleven o&#8217;clock
interval that morning to avenge the insult.</p>

<p>Mr. Downing&#8217;s methods of retaliation
would have to be, of necessity, more elusive; but
Mike did not doubt that in some way or other his form-master
would endeavour to get a bit of his own back.</p>

<p>As events turned out, he was perfectly
right.&#160; When a master has got his knife into a
boy, especially a master who allows himself to be
influenced by his likes and dislikes, he is inclined
to single him out in times of stress, and savage him
as if he were the official representative of the evildoers.&#160;
Just as, at sea, the skipper, when he has trouble
with the crew, works it off on the boy.</p>

<p>Mr. Downing was in a sarcastic mood
when he met Mike.&#160; That is to say, he began in
a sarcastic strain.&#160; But this sort of thing is
difficult to keep up.&#160; By the time he had reached
his peroration, the rapier had given place to the
bludgeon.&#160; For sarcasm to be effective, the user
of it must be met half-way.&#160; His hearer must appear
to be conscious of the sarcasm and moved by it.&#160;
Mike, when masters waxed sarcastic towards him, always
assumed an air of stolid stupidity, which was as a
suit of mail against satire.</p>

<p>So Mr. Downing came down from the
heights with a run, and began to express himself with
a simple strength which it did his form good to listen
to.&#160; Veterans who had been in the form for terms
said afterwards that there had been nothing to touch
it, in their experience of the orator, since the glorious
day when Dunster, that prince of raggers, who had
left at Christmas to go to a crammer&#8217;s, had introduced
three lively grass-snakes into the room during a Latin
lesson.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are surrounded,&#8221;
concluded Mr. Downing, snapping his pencil in two
in his emotion, &#8220;by an impenetrable mass of conceit
and vanity and selfishness.&#160; It does not occur
to you to admit your capabilities as a cricketer in
an open, straightforward way and place them at the
disposal of the school.&#160; No, that would not be
dramatic enough for you.&#160; It would be too commonplace
altogether.&#160; Far too commonplace!&#8221; Mr. Downing
laughed bitterly.&#160; &#8220;No, you must conceal
your capabilities.&#160; You must act a lie.&#160; You
must&#8212;&#173;who is that shuffling his feet?&#160;
I will not have it, I <i>will</i> have silence&#8212;&#173;you
must hang back in order to make a more effective entrance,
like some wretched actor who&#8212;&#173;I will <i>not</i>
have this shuffling.&#160; I have spoken of this before.&#160;
Macpherson, are you shuffling your feet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir, no, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Parsons?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s the noise of the draught
under the door, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instant departure of Parsons for the
outer regions.&#160; And, in the excitement of this
side-issue, the speaker lost his inspiration, and
abruptly concluded his remarks by putting Mike on to
translate in Cicero.&#160; Which Mike, who happened
to have prepared the first half-page, did with much
success.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>The Old Boys&#8217; match was timed
to begin shortly after eleven o&#8217;clock.&#160;
During the interval most of the school walked across
the field to look at the pitch.&#160; One or two of
the Old Boys had already changed and were practising
in front of the pavilion.</p>

<p>It was through one of these batsmen
that an accident occurred which had a good deal of
influence on Mike&#8217;s affairs.</p>

<p>Mike had strolled out by himself.&#160;
Half-way across the field Jellicoe joined him.&#160;
Jellicoe was cheerful, and rather embarrassingly grateful.&#160;
He was just in the middle of his harangue when the
accident happened.</p>

<p>To their left, as they crossed the
field, a long youth, with the faint beginnings of
a moustache and a blazer that lit up the surrounding
landscape like a glowing beacon, was lashing out recklessly
at a friend&#8217;s bowling.&#160; Already he had gone
within an ace of slaying a small boy.&#160; As Mike
and Jellicoe proceeded on their way, there was a shout
of &#8220;Heads!&#8221;</p>

<p>The almost universal habit of batsmen
of shouting &#8220;Heads!&#8221; at whatever height
from the ground the ball may be, is not a little confusing.&#160;
The average person, on hearing the shout, puts his
hands over his skull, crouches down and trusts to
luck.&#160; This is an excellent plan if the ball is
falling, but is not much protection against a skimming
drive along the ground.</p>

<p>When &#8220;Heads!&#8221; was called
on the present occasion, Mike and Jellicoe instantly
assumed the crouching attitude.</p>

<p>Jellicoe was the first to abandon
it.&#160; He uttered a yell and sprang into the air.&#160;
After which he sat down and began to nurse his ankle.</p>

<p>The bright-blazered youth walked up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Awfully sorry, you know, man.&#160; Hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jellicoe was pressing the injured
spot tenderly with his finger-tips, uttering sharp
howls whenever, zeal outrunning discretion, he prodded
himself too energetically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silly ass, Dunster,&#8221; he groaned, &#8220;slamming
about like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Awfully sorry.&#160; But I did yell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s swelling up rather,&#8221;
said Mike.&#160; &#8220;You&#8217;d better get over
to the house and have it looked at.&#160; Can you walk?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jellicoe tried, but sat down again
with a loud &#8220;Ow!&#8221; At that moment the bell
rang.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall have to be going in,&#8221;
said Mike, &#8220;or I&#8217;d have helped you over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you a hand,&#8221; said Dunster.</p>

<p>He helped the sufferer to his feet
and they staggered off together, Jellicoe hopping,
Dunster advancing with a sort of polka step.&#160; Mike
watched them start and then turned to go in.</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch43">
CHAPTER XLIII<br><br>
MIKE RECEIVES A COMMISSION</a></h3>

<p>There is only one thing to be said
in favour of detention on a fine summer&#8217;s afternoon,
and that is that it is very pleasant to come out of.&#160;
The sun never seems so bright or the turf so green
as during the first five minutes after one has come
out of the detention-room.&#160; One feels as if one
were entering a new and very delightful world.&#160;
There is also a touch of the Rip van Winkle feeling.&#160;
Everything seems to have gone on and left one behind.&#160;
Mike, as he walked to the cricket field, felt very
much behind the times.</p>

<p>Arriving on the field he found the
Old Boys batting.&#160; He stopped and watched an over
of Adair&#8217;s.&#160; The fifth ball bowled a man.&#160;
Mike made his way towards the pavilion.</p>

<p>Before he got there he heard his name
called, and turning, found Psmith seated under a tree
with the bright-blazered Dunster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Return of the exile,&#8221;
said Psmith.&#160; &#8220;A joyful occasion tinged with
melancholy.&#160; Have a cherry?&#8212;&#173;take one
or two.&#160; These little acts of unremembered kindness
are what one needs after a couple of hours in extra
pupil-room.&#160; Restore your tissues, Comrade Jackson,
and when you have finished those, apply again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is your name Jackson?&#8221;
inquired Dunster, &#8220;because Jellicoe wants to
see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas, poor Jellicoe!&#8221;
said Psmith.&#160; &#8220;He is now prone on his bed
in the dormitory&#8212;&#173;there a sheer hulk lies
poor Tom Jellicoe, the darling of the crew, faithful
below he did his duty, but Comrade Dunster has broached
him to.&#160; I have just been hearing the melancholy
details.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Smith and I,&#8221; said
Dunster, &#8220;were at a private school together.&#160;
I&#8217;d no idea I should find him here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a wonderfully stirring
sight when we met,&#8221; said Psmith; &#8220;not
unlike the meeting of Ulysses and the hound Argos,
of whom you have doubtless read in the course of your
dabblings in the classics.&#160; I was Ulysses; Dunster
gave a life-like representation of the faithful dawg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You still jaw as much as ever,
I notice,&#8221; said the animal delineator, fondling
the beginnings of his moustache.</p>

<p>&#8220;More,&#8221; sighed Psmith,
&#8220;more.&#160; Is anything irritating you?&#8221;
he added, eyeing the other&#8217;s manoeuvres with
interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t be a funny
ass, man,&#8221; said Dunster, pained; &#8220;heaps
of people tell me I ought to have it waxed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What it really wants is top-dressing
with guano.&#160; Hullo! another man out.&#160; Adair&#8217;s
bowling better to-day than he did yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard about yesterday,&#8221;
said Dunster.&#160; &#8220;It must have been a rag!&#160;
Couldn&#8217;t we work off some other rag on somebody
before I go?&#160; I shall be stopping here till Monday
in the village.&#160; Well hit, sir&#8212;&#173;Adair&#8217;s
bowling is perfectly simple if you go out to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Comrade Dunster went out to
it first ball,&#8221; said Psmith to Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! chuck it, man; the sun
was in my eyes.&#160; I hear Adair&#8217;s got a match
on with the M.C.C. at last.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has he?&#8221; said Psmith;
&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t heard.&#160; Archaeology claims
so much of my time that I have little leisure for
listening to cricket chit-chat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was it Jellicoe wanted?&#8221;
asked Mike; &#8220;was it anything important?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He seemed to think so&#8212;&#173;he
kept telling me to tell you to go and see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear Comrade Jellicoe is
a bit of a weak-minded blitherer&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever hear of a rag
we worked off on Jellicoe once?&#8221; asked Dunster.&#160;
&#8220;The man has absolutely no sense of humour&#8212;&#173;can&#8217;t
see when he&#8217;s being rotted.&#160; Well it was
like this&#8212;&#173;Hullo!&#160; We&#8217;re all out&#8212;&#173;I
shall have to be going out to field again, I suppose,
dash it!&#160; I&#8217;ll tell you when I see you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall count the minutes,&#8221; said Psmith.</p>

<p>Mike stretched himself; the sun was
very soothing after his two hours in the detention-room;
he felt disinclined for exertion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose it&#8217;s
anything special about Jellicoe, do you?&#8221; he
said.&#160; &#8220;I mean, it&#8217;ll keep till tea-time;
it&#8217;s no catch having to sweat across to the
house now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t dream of moving,&#8221;
said Psmith.&#160; &#8220;I have several rather profound
observations on life to make and I can&#8217;t make
them without an audience.&#160; Soliloquy is a knack.&#160;
Hamlet had got it, but probably only after years of
patient practice.&#160; Personally, I need some one
to listen when I talk.&#160; I like to feel that I
am doing good.&#160; You stay where you are&#8212;&#173;don&#8217;t
interrupt too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike tilted his hat over his eyes
and abandoned Jellicoe.</p>

<p>It was not until the lock-up bell
rang that he remembered him.&#160; He went over to
the house and made his way to the dormitory, where
he found the injured one in a parlous state, not so
much physical as mental.&#160; The doctor had seen
his ankle and reported that it would be on the active
list in a couple of days.&#160; It was Jellicoe&#8217;s
mind that needed attention now.</p>

<p>Mike found him in a condition bordering on collapse.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, you might have come before!&#8221; said
Jellicoe.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#160; I didn&#8217;t
know there was such a hurry about it&#8212;&#173;what
did you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no good now,&#8221;
said Jellicoe gloomily; &#8220;it&#8217;s too late,
I shall get sacked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth are you talking about?&#160; What&#8217;s
the row?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about that money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had to pay it to a man to-day,
or he said he&#8217;d write to the Head&#8212;&#173;then
of course I should get sacked.&#160; I was going to
take the money to him this afternoon, only I got crocked,
so I couldn&#8217;t move.&#160; I wanted to get hold
of you to ask you to take it for me&#8212;&#173;it&#8217;s
too late now!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike&#8217;s face fell.&#160; &#8220;Oh,
hang it!&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m awfully sorry.&#160;
I&#8217;d no idea it was anything like that&#8212;&#173;what
a fool I was!&#160; Dunster did say he thought it was
something important, only like an ass I thought it
would do if I came over at lock-up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter,&#8221;
said Jellicoe miserably; &#8220;it can&#8217;t be helped.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it can,&#8221; said Mike.&#160;
&#8220;I know what I&#8217;ll do&#8212;&#173;it&#8217;s
all right.&#160; I&#8217;ll get out of the house after
lights-out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jellicoe sat up.&#160; &#8220;You can&#8217;t!&#160;
You&#8217;d get sacked if you were caught.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who would catch me?&#160; There
was a chap at Wrykyn I knew who used to break out
every night nearly and go and pot at cats with an air-pistol;
it&#8217;s as easy as anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>The toad-under-the-harrow expression
began to fade from Jellicoe&#8217;s face.&#160; &#8220;I
say, do you think you could, really?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I can!&#160; It&#8217;ll be rather
a rag.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, it&#8217;s frightfully decent of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What absolute rot!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, look here, are you certain&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be all right.&#160; Where do you want
me to go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a place about a mile or two from
here, called Lower Borlock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lower Borlock?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, do you know it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather!&#160; I&#8217;ve been playing cricket
for them all the term.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, have you?&#160; Do you know a man called
Barley?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Barley?&#160; Rather&#8212;&#173;he runs the
&#8217;White Boar&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the chap I owe the money to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Barley!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike knew the landlord of the &#8220;White
Boar&#8221; well; he was the wag of the village team.&#160;
Every village team, for some mysterious reason, has
its comic man.&#160; In the Lower Borlock eleven Mr.
Barley filled the post.&#160; He was a large, stout
man, with a red and cheerful face, who looked exactly
like the jovial inn-keeper of melodrama.&#160; He was
the last man Mike would have expected to do the &#8220;money
by Monday-week or I write to the headmaster&#8221;
business.</p>

<p>But he reflected that he had only
seen him in his leisure moments, when he might naturally
be expected to unbend and be full of the milk of human
kindness.&#160; Probably in business hours he was quite
different.&#160; After all, pleasure is one thing and
business another.</p>

<p>Besides, five pounds is a large sum
of money, and if Jellicoe owed it, there was nothing
strange in Mr. Barley&#8217;s doing everything he could
to recover it.</p>

<p>He wondered a little what Jellicoe
could have been doing to run up a bill as big as that,
but it did not occur to him to ask, which was unfortunate,
as it might have saved him a good deal of inconvenience.&#160;
It seemed to him that it was none of his business to
inquire into Jellicoe&#8217;s private affairs.&#160;
He took the envelope containing the money without
question.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall bike there, I think,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;if I can get into the shed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The school&#8217;s bicycles were stored
in a shed by the pavilion.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can manage that,&#8221;
said Jellicoe; &#8220;it&#8217;s locked up at night,
but I had a key made to fit it last summer, because
I used to go out in the early morning sometimes before
it was opened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Got it on you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Smith&#8217;s got it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get it from him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell Smith why
you want it, will you?&#160; I don&#8217;t want anybody
to know&#8212;&#173;if a thing once starts getting
about it&#8217;s all over the place in no time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, I won&#8217;t tell him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, thanks most awfully!&#160;
I don&#8217;t know what I should have done, I&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, chuck it!&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch44">
CHAPTER XLIV<br><br>
AND FULFILS IT</a></h3>

<p>Mike started on his ride to Lower
Borlock with mixed feelings.&#160; It is pleasant to
be out on a fine night in summer, but the pleasure
is to a certain extent modified when one feels that
to be detected will mean expulsion.</p>

<p>Mike did not want to be expelled,
for many reasons.&#160; Now that he had grown used
to the place he was enjoying himself at Sedleigh to
a certain extent.&#160; He still harboured a feeling
of resentment against the school in general and Adair
in particular, but it was pleasant in Outwood&#8217;s
now that he had got to know some of the members of
the house, and he liked playing cricket for Lower
Borlock; also, he was fairly certain that his father
would not let him go to Cambridge if he were expelled
from Sedleigh.&#160; Mr. Jackson was easy-going with
his family, but occasionally his foot came down like
a steam-hammer, as witness the Wrykyn school report
affair.</p>

<p>So Mike pedalled along rapidly, being
wishful to get the job done without delay.</p>

<p>Psmith had yielded up the key, but
his inquiries as to why it was needed had been embarrassing.&#160;
Mike&#8217;s statement that he wanted to get up early
and have a ride had been received by Psmith, with whom
early rising was not a hobby, with honest amazement
and a flood of advice and warning on the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the Georges,&#8221;
said Psmith, &#8220;I forget which, once said that
a certain number of hours&#8217; sleep a day&#8212;&#173;I
cannot recall for the moment how many&#8212;&#173;made
a man something, which for the time being has slipped
my memory.&#160; However, there you are.&#160; I&#8217;ve
given you the main idea of the thing; and a German
doctor says that early rising causes insanity.&#160;
Still, if you&#8217;re bent on it&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;
After which he had handed over the key.</p>

<p>Mike wished he could have taken Psmith
into his confidence.&#160; Probably he would have volunteered
to come, too; Mike would have been glad of a companion.</p>

<p>It did not take him long to reach
Lower Borlock.&#160; The &#8220;White Boar&#8221; stood
at the far end of the village, by the cricket field.&#160;
He rode past the church&#8212;&#173;standing out black
and mysterious against the light sky&#8212;&#173;and
the rows of silent cottages, until he came to the inn.</p>

<p>The place was shut, of course, and
all the lights were out&#8212;&#173;it was some time
past eleven.</p>

<p>The advantage an inn has over a private
house, from the point of view of the person who wants
to get into it when it has been locked up, is that
a nocturnal visit is not so unexpected in the case
of the former.&#160; Preparations have been made to
meet such an emergency.&#160; Where with a private
house you would probably have to wander round heaving
rocks and end by climbing up a water-spout, when you
want to get into an inn you simply ring the night-bell,
which, communicating with the boots&#8217; room, has
that hard-worked menial up and doing in no time.</p>

<p>After Mike had waited for a few minutes
there was a rattling of chains and a shooting of bolts
and the door opened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir?&#8221; said the boots,
appearing in his shirt-sleeves.&#160; &#8220;Why, &#8217;ullo!&#160;
Mr. Jackson, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike was well known to all dwellers
in Lower Borlock, his scores being the chief topic
of conversation when the day&#8217;s labours were over.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to see Mr. Barley, Jack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s bin in bed this half-hour back,
Mr. Jackson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must see him.&#160; Can you get him down?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boots looked doubtful.&#160; &#8220;Roust the guv&#8217;nor
outer bed?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Mike quite admitted the gravity of
the task.&#160; The landlord of the &#8220;White Boar&#8221;
was one of those men who need a beauty sleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you would&#8212;&#173;it&#8217;s
a thing that can&#8217;t wait.&#160; I&#8217;ve got
some money to give to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if it&#8217;s <i>that</i>&#8212;&#173;&#8221;
said the boots.</p>

<p>Five minutes later mine host appeared
in person, looking more than usually portly in a check
dressing-gown and red bedroom slippers of the <i>Dreadnought</i>
type.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can pop off, Jack.&#8221;</p>

<p>Exit boots to his slumbers once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Jackson, what&#8217;s it all about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jellicoe asked me to come and bring you the
money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The money?&#160; What money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What he owes you; the five pounds, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The five&#8212;&#173;&#8221;
Mr. Barley stared open-mouthed at Mike for a moment;
then he broke into a roar of laughter which shook the
sporting prints on the wall and drew barks from dogs
in some distant part of the house.&#160; He staggered
about laughing and coughing till Mike began to expect
a fit of some kind.&#160; Then he collapsed into a chair,
which creaked under him, and wiped his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear!&#8221; he said, &#8220;oh dear! the
five pounds!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike was not always abreast of the
rustic idea of humour, and now he felt particularly
fogged.&#160; For the life of him he could not see
what there was to amuse any one so much in the fact
that a person who owed five pounds was ready to pay
it back.&#160; It was an occasion for rejoicing, perhaps,
but rather for a solemn, thankful, eyes-raised-to-heaven
kind of rejoicing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Five pounds!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might tell us the joke.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Barley opened the letter, read
it, and had another attack; when this was finished
he handed the letter to Mike, who was waiting patiently
by, hoping for light, and requested him to read it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear, dear!&#8221; chuckled
Mr. Barley, &#8220;five pounds!&#160; They may teach
you young gentlemen to talk Latin and Greek and what
not at your school, but it &#8217;ud do a lot more
good if they&#8217;d teach you how many beans make
five; it &#8217;ud do a lot more good if they&#8217;d
teach you to come in when it rained, it &#8217;ud
do&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike was reading the letter.</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;DEAR MR. BARLEY,&#8221; it ran.&#8212;&#173;&#8220;I
send the &#163;5, which I could not get before.&#160;
I hope it is in time, because I don&#8217;t want you
to write to the headmaster.&#160; I am sorry Jane
and John ate your wife&#8217;s hat and the chicken
and broke the vase.&#8221;</blockquote>

<p>There was some more to the same effect;
it was signed &#8220;T.&#160; G. Jellicoe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth&#8217;s it all
about?&#8221; said Mike, finishing this curious document.</p>

<p>Mr. Barley slapped his leg.&#160; &#8220;Why,
Mr. Jellicoe keeps two dogs here; I keep &#8217;em
for him till the young gentlemen go home for their
holidays.&#160; Aberdeen terriers, they are, and as
sharp as mustard.&#160; Mischief!&#160; I believe you,
but, love us! they don&#8217;t do no harm!&#160; Bite
up an old shoe sometimes and such sort of things.&#160;
The other day, last Wednesday it were, about &#8217;ar
parse five, Jane&#8212;&#173;she&#8217;s the worst of
the two, always up to it, she is&#8212;&#173;she got
hold of my old hat and had it in bits before you could
say knife.&#160; John upset a china vase in one of the
bedrooms chasing a mouse, and they got on the coffee-room
table and ate half a cold chicken what had been left
there.&#160; So I says to myself, &#8217;I&#8217;ll
have a game with Mr. Jellicoe over this,&#8217; and
I sits down and writes off saying the little dogs
have eaten a valuable hat and a chicken and what not,
and the damage&#8217;ll be five pounds, and will he
kindly remit same by Saturday night at the latest
or I write to his headmaster.&#160; Love us!&#8221;
Mr. Barley slapped his thigh, &#8220;he took it all
in, every word&#8212;&#173;and here&#8217;s the five
pounds in cash in this envelope here!&#160; I haven&#8217;t
had such a laugh since we got old Tom Raxley out of
bed at twelve of a winter&#8217;s night by telling
him his house was a-fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is not always easy to appreciate
a joke of the practical order if one has been made
even merely part victim of it.&#160; Mike, as he reflected
that he had been dragged out of his house in the middle
of the night, in contravention of all school rules
and discipline, simply in order to satisfy Mr. Barley&#8217;s
sense of humour, was more inclined to be abusive than
mirthful.&#160; Running risks is all very well when
they are necessary, or if one chooses to run them
for one&#8217;s own amusement, but to be placed in
a dangerous position, a position imperilling one&#8217;s
chance of going to the &#8217;Varsity, is another matter
altogether.</p>

<p>But it is impossible to abuse the
Barley type of man.&#160; Barley&#8217;s enjoyment
of the whole thing was so honest and child-like.&#160;
Probably it had given him the happiest quarter of
an hour he had known for years, since, in fact, the
affair of old Tom Raxley.&#160; It would have been cruel
to damp the man.</p>

<p>So Mike laughed perfunctorily, took
back the envelope with the five pounds, accepted a
stone ginger beer and a plateful of biscuits, and
rode off on his return journey.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>Mention has been made above of the
difference which exists between getting into an inn
after lock-up and into a private house.&#160; Mike was
to find this out for himself.</p>

<p>His first act on arriving at Sedleigh
was to replace his bicycle in the shed.&#160; This
he accomplished with success.&#160; It was pitch-dark
in the shed, and as he wheeled his machine in, his
foot touched something on the floor.&#160; Without
waiting to discover what this might be, he leaned
his bicycle against the wall, went out, and locked
the door, after which he ran across to Outwood&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Fortune had favoured his undertaking
by decreeing that a stout drain-pipe should pass up
the wall within a few inches of his and Psmith&#8217;s
study.&#160; On the first day of term, it may be remembered
he had wrenched away the wooden bar which bisected
the window-frame, thus rendering exit and entrance
almost as simple as they had been for Wyatt during
Mike&#8217;s first term at Wrykyn.</p>

<p>He proceeded to scale this water-pipe.</p>

<p>He had got about half-way up when a voice from somewhere
below cried, &#8220;Who&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch45">
CHAPTER XLV<br><br>
PURSUIT</a></h3>

<p>These things are Life&#8217;s Little
Difficulties.&#160; One can never tell precisely how
one will act in a sudden emergency.&#160; The right
thing for Mike to have done at this crisis was to
have ignored the voice, carried on up the water-pipe,
and through the study window, and gone to bed.&#160;
It was extremely unlikely that anybody could have recognised
him at night against the dark background of the house.&#160;
The position then would have been that somebody in
Mr. Outwood&#8217;s house had been seen breaking in
after lights-out; but it would have been very difficult
for the authorities to have narrowed the search down
any further than that.&#160; There were thirty-four
boys in Outwood&#8217;s, of whom about fourteen were
much the same size and build as Mike.</p>

<p>The suddenness, however, of the call
caused Mike to lose his head.&#160; He made the strategic
error of sliding rapidly down the pipe, and running.</p>

<p>There were two gates to Mr. Outwood&#8217;s
front garden.&#160; The carriage drive ran in a semicircle,
of which the house was the centre.&#160; It was from
the right-hand gate, nearest to Mr. Downing&#8217;s
house, that the voice had come, and, as Mike came
to the ground, he saw a stout figure galloping towards
him from that direction.&#160; He bolted like a rabbit
for the other gate.&#160; As he did so, his pursuer
again gave tongue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oo-oo-oo yer!&#8221; was the exact remark.</p>

<p>Whereby Mike recognised him as the school sergeant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oo-oo-oo yer!&#8221; was that
militant gentleman&#8217;s habitual way of beginning
a conversation.</p>

<p>With this knowledge, Mike felt easier
in his mind.&#160; Sergeant Collard was a man of many
fine qualities, (notably a talent for what he was
wont to call &#8220;spott&#8217;n,&#8221; a mysterious
gift which he exercised on the rifle range), but he
could not run.&#160; There had been a time in his hot
youth when he had sprinted like an untamed mustang
in pursuit of volatile Pathans in Indian hill wars,
but Time, increasing his girth, had taken from him
the taste for such exercise.&#160; When he moved now
it was at a stately walk.&#160; The fact that he ran
to-night showed how the excitement of the chase had
entered into his blood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oo-oo-oo yer!&#8221; he shouted
again, as Mike, passing through the gate, turned into
the road that led to the school.&#160; Mike&#8217;s
attentive ear noted that the bright speech was a shade
more puffily delivered this time.&#160; He began to
feel that this was not such bad fun after all.&#160;
He would have liked to be in bed, but, if that was
out of the question, this was certainly the next best
thing.</p>

<p>He ran on, taking things easily, with
the sergeant panting in his wake, till he reached
the entrance to the school grounds.&#160; He dashed
in and took cover behind a tree.</p>

<p>Presently the sergeant turned the
corner, going badly and evidently cured of a good
deal of the fever of the chase.&#160; Mike heard him
toil on for a few yards and then stop.&#160; A sound
of panting was borne to him.</p>

<p>Then the sound of footsteps returning,
this time at a walk.&#160; They passed the gate and
went on down the road.</p>

<p>The pursuer had given the thing up.</p>

<p>Mike waited for several minutes behind
his tree.&#160; His programme now was simple.&#160;
He would give Sergeant Collard about half an hour,
in case the latter took it into his head to &#8220;guard
home&#8221; by waiting at the gate.&#160; Then he would
trot softly back, shoot up the water-pipe once more,
and so to bed.&#160; It had just struck a quarter to
something&#8212;&#173;twelve, he supposed&#8212;&#173;on
the school clock.&#160; He would wait till a quarter
past.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there was nothing to be
gained from lurking behind a tree.&#160; He left his
cover, and started to stroll in the direction of the
pavilion.&#160; Having arrived there, he sat on the
steps, looking out on to the cricket field.</p>

<p>His thoughts were miles away, at Wrykyn,
when he was recalled to Sedleigh by the sound of somebody
running.&#160; Focussing his gaze, he saw a dim figure
moving rapidly across the cricket field straight for
him.</p>

<p>His first impression, that he had
been seen and followed, disappeared as the runner,
instead of making for the pavilion, turned aside, and
stopped at the door of the bicycle shed.&#160; Like
Mike, he was evidently possessed of a key, for Mike
heard it grate in the lock.&#160; At this point he
left the pavilion and hailed his fellow rambler by
night in a cautious undertone.</p>

<p>The other appeared startled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who the dickens is that?&#8221; he asked.&#160;
&#8220;Is that you, Jackson?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike recognised Adair&#8217;s voice.&#160;
The last person he would have expected to meet at
midnight obviously on the point of going for a bicycle
ride.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing out here, Jackson?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you, if it comes to that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Adair was lighting his lamp.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going for the doctor.&#160; One of
the chaps in our house is bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing out here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just been for a stroll.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t you better be getting back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Plenty of time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you think you&#8217;re
doing something tremendously brave and dashing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t you better be going to the doctor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you want to know what I think&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t.&#160; So long.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike turned away, whistling between
his teeth.&#160; After a moment&#8217;s pause, Adair
rode off.&#160; Mike saw his light pass across the field
and through the gate.&#160; The school clock struck
the quarter.</p>

<p>It seemed to Mike that Sergeant Collard,
even if he had started to wait for him at the house,
would not keep up the vigil for more than half an
hour.&#160; He would be safe now in trying for home
again.</p>

<p>He walked in that direction.</p>

<p>Now it happened that Mr. Downing,
aroused from his first sleep by the news, conveyed
to him by Adair, that MacPhee, one of the junior members
of Adair&#8217;s dormitory, was groaning and exhibiting
other symptoms of acute illness, was disturbed in
his mind.&#160; Most housemasters feel uneasy in the
event of illness in their houses, and Mr. Downing
was apt to get jumpy beyond the ordinary on such occasions.&#160;
All that was wrong with MacPhee, as a matter of fact,
was a very fair stomach-ache, the direct and legitimate
result of eating six buns, half a cocoa-nut, three
doughnuts, two ices, an apple, and a pound of cherries,
and washing the lot down with tea.&#160; But Mr. Downing
saw in his attack the beginnings of some deadly scourge
which would sweep through and decimate the house.&#160;
He had despatched Adair for the doctor, and, after
spending a few minutes prowling restlessly about his
room, was now standing at his front gate, waiting for
Adair&#8217;s return.</p>

<p>It came about, therefore, that Mike,
sprinting lightly in the direction of home and safety,
had his already shaken nerves further maltreated by
being hailed, at a range of about two yards, with a
cry of &#8220;Is that you, Adair?&#8221; The next
moment Mr. Downing emerged from his gate.</p>

<p>Mike stood not upon the order of his
going.&#160; He was off like an arrow&#8212;&#173;a
flying figure of Guilt.&#160; Mr. Downing, after the
first surprise, seemed to grasp the situation.&#160;
Ejaculating at intervals the words, &#8220;Who is
that?&#160; Stop!&#160; Who is that?&#160; Stop!&#8221;
he dashed after the much-enduring Wrykynian at an
extremely creditable rate of speed.&#160; Mr. Downing
was by way of being a sprinter.&#160; He had won handicap
events at College sports at Oxford, and, if Mike had
not got such a good start, the race might have been
over in the first fifty yards.&#160; As it was, that
victim of Fate, going well, kept ahead.&#160; At the
entrance to the school grounds he led by a dozen yards.&#160;
The procession passed into the field, Mike heading
as before for the pavilion.</p>

<p>As they raced across the soft turf,
an idea occurred to Mike which he was accustomed in
after years to attribute to genius, the one flash of
it which had ever illumined his life.</p>

<p>It was this.</p>

<p>One of Mr. Downing&#8217;s first acts,
on starting the Fire Brigade at Sedleigh, had been
to institute an alarm bell.&#160; It had been rubbed
into the school officially&#8212;&#173;in speeches
from the da&#239;s&#8212;&#173;by the headmaster, and unofficially&#8212;&#173;in
earnest private conversations&#8212;&#173;by Mr. Downing,
that at the sound of this bell, at whatever hour of
day or night, every member of the school must leave
his house in the quickest possible way, and make for
the open.&#160; The bell might mean that the school
was on fire, or it might mean that one of the houses
was on fire.&#160; In any case, the school had its
orders&#8212;&#173;to get out into the open at once.</p>

<p>Nor must it be supposed that the school
was without practice at this feat.&#160; Every now
and then a notice would be found posted up on the
board to the effect that there would be fire drill
during the dinner hour that day.&#160; Sometimes the
performance was bright and interesting, as on the
occasion when Mr. Downing, marshalling the brigade
at his front gate, had said, &#8220;My house is supposed
to be on fire.&#160; Now let&#8217;s do a record!&#8221;
which the Brigade, headed by Stone and Robinson, obligingly
did.&#160; They fastened the hose to the hydrant, smashed
a window on the ground floor (Mr. Downing having retired
for a moment to talk with the headmaster), and poured
a stream of water into the room.&#160; When Mr. Downing
was at liberty to turn his attention to the matter,
he found that the room selected was his private study,
most of the light furniture of which was floating
on a miniature lake.&#160; That episode had rather
discouraged his passion for realism, and fire drill
since then had taken the form, for the most part, of
&#8220;practising escaping.&#8221;&#160; This was done
by means of canvas shoots, kept in the dormitories.&#160;
At the sound of the bell the prefect of the dormitory
would heave one end of the shoot out of window, the
other end being fastened to the sill.&#160; He would
then go down it himself, using his elbows as a brake.&#160;
Then the second man would follow his example, and
these two, standing below, would hold the end of the
shoot so that the rest of the dormitory could fly
rapidly down it without injury, except to their digestions.</p>

<p>After the first novelty of the thing
had worn off, the school had taken a rooted dislike
to fire drill.&#160; It was a matter for self-congratulation
among them that Mr. Downing had never been able to
induce the headmaster to allow the alarm bell to be
sounded for fire drill at night.&#160; The headmaster,
a man who had his views on the amount of sleep necessary
for the growing boy, had drawn the line at night operations.&#160;
&#8220;Sufficient unto the day&#8221; had been the
gist of his reply.&#160; If the alarm bell were to
ring at night when there was no fire, the school might
mistake a genuine alarm of fire for a bogus one, and
refuse to hurry themselves.</p>

<p>So Mr. Downing had had to be content with day drill.</p>

<p>The alarm bell hung in the archway
leading into the school grounds.&#160; The end of the
rope, when not in use, was fastened to a hook half-way
up the wall.</p>

<p>Mike, as he raced over the cricket
field, made up his mind in a flash that his only chance
of getting out of this tangle was to shake his pursuer
off for a space of time long enough to enable him to
get to the rope and tug it.&#160; Then the school would
come out.&#160; He would mix with them, and in the
subsequent confusion get back to bed unnoticed.</p>

<p>The task was easier than it would
have seemed at the beginning of the chase.&#160; Mr.
Downing, owing to the two facts that he was not in
the strictest training, and that it is only an Alfred
Shrubb who can run for any length of time at top speed
shouting &#8220;Who is that?&#160; Stop!&#160; Who is
that?&#160; Stop!&#8221; was beginning to feel distressed.&#160;
There were bellows to mend in the Downing camp.&#160;
Mike perceived this, and forced the pace.&#160; He
rounded the pavilion ten yards to the good.&#160; Then,
heading for the gate, he put all he knew into one
last sprint.&#160; Mr. Downing was not equal to the
effort.&#160; He worked gamely for a few strides, then
fell behind.&#160; When Mike reached the gate, a good
forty yards separated them.</p>

<p>As far as Mike could judge&#8212;&#173;he
was not in a condition to make nice calculations&#8212;&#173;he
had about four seconds in which to get busy with that
bell rope.</p>

<p>Probably nobody has ever crammed more
energetic work into four seconds than he did then.</p>

<p>The night was as still as only an
English summer night can be, and the first clang of
the clapper sounded like a million iron girders falling
from a height on to a sheet of tin.&#160; He tugged
away furiously, with an eye on the now rapidly advancing
and loudly shouting figure of the housemaster.</p>

<p>And from the darkened house beyond
there came a gradually swelling hum, as if a vast
hive of bees had been disturbed.</p>

<p>The school was awake.</p>

CHAPTER XLVI<br><br>
THE DECORATION OF SAMMY</a></h3>

<p>Psmith leaned against the mantelpiece
in the senior day-room at Outwood&#8217;s&#8212;&#173;since
Mike&#8217;s innings against Downing&#8217;s the Lost
Lambs had been received as brothers by that centre
of disorder, so that even Spiller was compelled to
look on the hatchet as buried&#8212;&#173;and gave his
views on the events of the preceding night, or, rather,
of that morning, for it was nearer one than twelve
when peace had once more fallen on the school.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing that happens in this
luny-bin,&#8221; said Psmith, &#8220;has power to
surprise me now.&#160; There was a time when I might
have thought it a little unusual to have to leave
the house through a canvas shoot at one o&#8217;clock
in the morning, but I suppose it&#8217;s quite the
regular thing here.&#160; Old school tradition, &#38;c.&#160;
Men leave the school, and find that they&#8217;ve
got so accustomed to jumping out of window that they
look on it as a sort of affectation to go out by the
door.&#160; I suppose none of you merchants can give
me any idea when the next knockabout entertainment
of this kind is likely to take place?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder who rang that bell!&#8221;
said Stone.&#160; &#8220;Jolly sporting idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe it was Downing himself.&#160;
If it was, I hope he&#8217;s satisfied.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jellicoe, who was appearing in society
supported by a stick, looked meaningly at Mike, and
giggled, receiving in answer a stony stare.&#160; Mike
had informed Jellicoe of the details of his interview
with Mr. Barley at the &#8220;White Boar,&#8221; and
Jellicoe, after a momentary splutter of wrath against
the practical joker, was now in a particularly light-hearted
mood.&#160; He hobbled about, giggling at nothing and
at peace with all the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a stirring scene,&#8221;
said Psmith.&#160; &#8220;The agility with which Comrade
Jellicoe boosted himself down the shoot was a triumph
of mind over matter.&#160; He seemed to forget his
ankle.&#160; It was the nearest thing to a Boneless
Acrobatic Wonder that I have ever seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was in a beastly funk, I can tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stone gurgled.</p>

<p>&#8220;So was I,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for
a bit.&#160; Then, when I saw that it was all a rag,
I began to look about for ways of doing the thing really
well.&#160; I emptied about six jugs of water on a
gang of kids under my window.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I rushed into Downing&#8217;s, and ragged some
of the beds,&#8221; said Robinson.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was an invigorating time,&#8221;
said Psmith.&#160; &#8220;A sort of pageant.&#160; I
was particularly struck with the way some of the bright
lads caught hold of the idea.&#160; There was no skimping.&#160;
Some of the kids, to my certain knowledge, went down
the shoot a dozen times.&#160; There&#8217;s nothing
like doing a thing thoroughly.&#160; I saw them come
down, rush upstairs, and be saved again, time after
time.&#160; The thing became chronic with them.&#160;
I should say Comrade Downing ought to be satisfied
with the high state of efficiency to which he has
brought us.&#160; At any rate I hope&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a sound of hurried footsteps
outside the door, and Sharpe, a member of the senior
day-room, burst excitedly in.&#160; He seemed amused.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, have you chaps seen Sammy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seen who?&#8221; said Stone.&#160; &#8220;Sammy?&#160;
Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll know in a second.&#160;
He&#8217;s just outside.&#160; Here, Sammy, Sammy,
Sammy!&#160; Sam!&#160; Sam!&#8221;</p>

<p>A bark and a patter of feet outside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Sammy.&#160; Good dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence.&#160;
Then a great yell of laughter burst forth.&#160; Even
Psmith&#8217;s massive calm was shattered.&#160; As
for Jellicoe, he sobbed in a corner.</p>

<p>Sammy&#8217;s beautiful white coat
was almost entirely concealed by a thick covering
of bright red paint.&#160; His head, with the exception
of the ears, was untouched, and his serious, friendly
eyes seemed to emphasise the weirdness of his appearance.&#160;
He stood in the doorway, barking and wagging his tail,
plainly puzzled at his reception.&#160; He was a popular
dog, and was always well received when he visited any
of the houses, but he had never before met with enthusiasm
like this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good old Sammy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth&#8217;s been happening to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who did it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sharpe, the introducer, had no views on the matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I found him outside Downing&#8217;s,
with a crowd round him.&#160; Everybody seems to have
seen him.&#160; I wonder who on earth has gone and mucked
him up like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike was the first to show any sympathy for the maltreated
animal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor old Sammy,&#8221; he said,
kneeling on the floor beside the victim, and scratching
him under the ear.&#160; &#8220;What a beastly shame!&#160;
It&#8217;ll take hours to wash all that off him, and
he&#8217;ll hate it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me,&#8221; said
Psmith, regarding Sammy dispassionately through his
eyeglass, &#8220;that it&#8217;s not a case for mere
washing.&#160; They&#8217;ll either have to skin him
bodily, or leave the thing to time.&#160; Time, the
Great Healer.&#160; In a year or two he&#8217;ll fade
to a delicate pink.&#160; I don&#8217;t see why you
shouldn&#8217;t have a pink bull-terrier.&#160; It would
lend a touch of distinction to the place.&#160; Crowds
would come in excursion trains to see him.&#160; By
charging a small fee you might make him self-supporting.&#160;
I think I&#8217;ll suggest it to Comrade Downing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be a row about this,&#8221;
said Stone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rows are rather sport when
you&#8217;re not mixed up in them,&#8221; said Robinson,
philosophically.&#160; &#8220;There&#8217;ll be another
if we don&#8217;t start off for chapel soon.&#160;
It&#8217;s a quarter to.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a general move.&#160; Mike
was the last to leave the room.&#160; As he was going,
Jellicoe stopped him.&#160; Jellicoe was staying in
that Sunday, owing to his ankle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; said Jellicoe,
&#8220;I just wanted to thank you again about that&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but it really was awfully
decent of you.&#160; You might have got into a frightful
row.&#160; Were you nearly caught?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jolly nearly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It <i>was</i> you who rang the bell, wasn&#8217;t
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it was.&#160; But for goodness
sake don&#8217;t go gassing about it, or somebody
will get to hear who oughtn&#8217;t to, and I shall
be sacked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right.&#160; But, I say, you <i>are</i>
a chap!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean about Sammy, you know.&#160;
It&#8217;s a jolly good score off old Downing.&#160;
He&#8217;ll be frightfully sick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sammy!&#8221; cried Mike.&#160;
&#8220;My good man, you don&#8217;t think I did that,
do you?&#160; What absolute rot!&#160; I never touched
the poor brute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, all right,&#8221; said
Jellicoe.&#160; &#8220;But I wasn&#8217;t going to tell
any one, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>are</i> a chap!&#8221; giggled Jellicoe.</p>

<p>Mike walked to chapel rather thoughtfully.</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch47">
CHAPTER XLVII<br><br>
MR. DOWNING ON THE SCENT</a></h3>

<p>There was just one moment, the moment
in which, on going down to the junior day-room of
his house to quell an unseemly disturbance, he was
boisterously greeted by a vermilion bull terrier, when
Mr. Downing was seized with a hideous fear lest he
had lost his senses.&#160; Glaring down at the crimson
animal that was pawing at his knees, he clutched at
his reason for one second as a drowning man clutches
at a lifebelt.</p>

<p>Then the happy laughter of the young
onlookers reassured him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8212;&#173;&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;WHO
has done this?&#8221;</p>

<center><a name="illus10">
<img src="images/jmike10.jpg" alt="&#8220;WHO&#8212;&#173;&#8221; HE SHOUTED, &#8220;WHO HAS DONE THIS?&#8221;">
</a></center>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir, we don&#8217;t know,&#8221; shrilled
the chorus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir, he came in like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir, we were sitting here when he suddenly
ran in, all red.&#8221;</p>

<p>A voice from the crowd:&#160; &#8220;Look at old Sammy!&#8221;</p>

<p>The situation was impossible.&#160;
There was nothing to be done.&#160; He could not find
out by verbal inquiry who had painted the dog.&#160;
The possibility of Sammy being painted red during
the night had never occurred to Mr. Downing, and now
that the thing had happened he had no scheme of action.&#160;
As Psmith would have said, he had confused the unusual
with the impossible, and the result was that he was
taken by surprise.</p>

<p>While he was pondering on this the
situation was rendered still more difficult by Sammy,
who, taking advantage of the door being open, escaped
and rushed into the road, thus publishing his condition
to all and sundry.&#160; You can hush up a painted
dog while it confines itself to your own premises,
but once it has mixed with the great public this becomes
out of the question.&#160; Sammy&#8217;s state advanced
from a private trouble into a row.&#160; Mr. Downing&#8217;s
next move was in the same direction that Sammy had
taken, only, instead of running about the road, he
went straight to the headmaster.</p>

<p>The Head, who had had to leave his
house in the small hours in his pyjamas and a dressing-gown,
was not in the best of tempers.&#160; He had a cold
in the head, and also a rooted conviction that Mr.
Downing, in spite of his strict orders, had rung the
bell himself on the previous night in order to test
the efficiency of the school in saving themselves
in the event of fire.&#160; He received the housemaster
frostily, but thawed as the latter related the events
which had led up to the ringing of the bell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; he said, deeply
interested.&#160; &#8220;One of the boys at the school,
you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am certain of it,&#8221; said Mr. Downing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was he wearing a school cap?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was bare-headed.&#160; A
boy who breaks out of his house at night would hardly
run the risk of wearing a distinguishing cap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, I suppose not.&#160; A big boy, you
say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very big.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did not see his face?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was dark and he never looked
back&#8212;&#173;he was in front of me all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is another matter&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This boy, whoever he was, had
done something before he rang the bell&#8212;&#173;he
had painted my dog Sampson red.&#8221;</p>

<p>The headmaster&#8217;s eyes protruded
from their sockets.&#160; &#8220;He&#8212;&#173;he&#8212;&#173;<i>what</i>,
Mr. Downing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He painted my dog red&#8212;&#173;bright
red.&#8221;&#160; Mr. Downing was too angry to see
anything humorous in the incident.&#160; Since the previous
night he had been wounded in his tenderest feelings.&#160;
His Fire Brigade system had been most shamefully abused
by being turned into a mere instrument in the hands
of a malefactor for escaping justice, and his dog had
been held up to ridicule to all the world.&#160; He
did not want to smile, he wanted revenge.</p>

<p>The headmaster, on the other hand,
did want to smile.&#160; It was not his dog, he could
look on the affair with an unbiased eye, and to him
there was something ludicrous in a white dog suddenly
appearing as a red dog.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a scandalous thing!&#8221; said Mr. Downing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so!&#160; Quite so!&#8221;
said the headmaster hastily.&#160; &#8220;I shall punish
the boy who did it most severely.&#160; I will speak
to the school in the Hall after chapel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Which he did, but without result.&#160;
A cordial invitation to the criminal to come forward
and be executed was received in wooden silence by the
school, with the exception of Johnson III., of Outwood&#8217;s,
who, suddenly reminded of Sammy&#8217;s appearance
by the headmaster&#8217;s words, broke into a wild
screech of laughter, and was instantly awarded two
hundred lines.</p>

<p>The school filed out of the Hall to
their various lunches, and Mr. Downing was left with
the conviction that, if he wanted the criminal discovered,
he would have to discover him for himself.</p>

<p>The great thing in affairs of this
kind is to get a good start, and Fate, feeling perhaps
that it had been a little hard upon Mr. Downing, gave
him a most magnificent start.&#160; Instead of having
to hunt for a needle in a haystack, he found himself
in a moment in the position of being set to find it
in a mere truss of straw.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Outwood who helped him.&#160;
Sergeant Collard had waylaid the archaeological expert
on his way to chapel, and informed him that at close
on twelve the night before he had observed a youth,
unidentified, attempting to get into his house <i>via</i>
the water-pipe.&#160; Mr. Outwood, whose thoughts were
occupied with apses and plinths, not to mention cromlechs,
at the time, thanked the sergeant with absent-minded
politeness and passed on.&#160; Later he remembered
the fact <i>&#224; propos</i> of some reflections on the
subject of burglars in mediaeval England, and passed
it on to Mr. Downing as they walked back to lunch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the boy was in your house!&#8221;
exclaimed Mr. Downing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not actually in, as far as
I understand.&#160; I gather from the sergeant that
he interrupted him before&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean he must have been one
of the boys in your house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what was he doing out at that hour?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He had broken out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible, I think.&#160; Oh
yes, quite impossible!&#160; I went round the dormitories
as usual at eleven o&#8217;clock last night, and all
the boys were asleep&#8212;&#173;all of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downing was not listening.&#160;
He was in a state of suppressed excitement and exultation
which made it hard for him to attend to his colleague&#8217;s
slow utterances.&#160; He had a clue!&#160; Now that
the search had narrowed itself down to Outwood&#8217;s
house, the rest was comparatively easy.&#160; Perhaps
Sergeant Collard had actually recognised the boy.&#160;
Or reflection he dismissed this as unlikely, for the
sergeant would scarcely have kept a thing like that
to himself; but he might very well have seen more
of him than he, Downing, had seen.&#160; It was only
with an effort that he could keep himself from rushing
to the sergeant then and there, and leaving the house
lunch to look after itself.&#160; He resolved to go
the moment that meal was at an end.</p>

<p>Sunday lunch at a public-school house
is probably one of the longest functions in existence.&#160;
It drags its slow length along like a languid snake,
but it finishes in time.&#160; In due course Mr. Downing,
after sitting still and eyeing with acute dislike
everybody who asked for a second helping, found himself
at liberty.</p>

<p>Regardless of the claims of digestion,
he rushed forth on the trail.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>Sergeant Collard lived with his wife
and a family of unknown dimensions in the lodge at
the school front gate.&#160; Dinner was just over when
Mr. Downing arrived, as a blind man could have told.</p>

<p>The sergeant received his visitor
with dignity, ejecting the family, who were torpid
after roast beef and resented having to move, in order
to ensure privacy.</p>

<p>Having requested his host to smoke,
which the latter was about to do unasked, Mr. Downing
stated his case.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Outwood,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;tells me that last night, sergeant, you saw
a boy endeavouring to enter his house.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sergeant blew a cloud of smoke.&#160;
&#8220;Oo-oo-oo, yer,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I did,
sir&#8212;&#173;spotted &#8216;im, I did.&#160; Feeflee
good at spottin&#8217;, I am, sir.&#160; Dook of Connaught,
he used to say, &#8216;&#8217;Ere comes Sergeant Collard,&#8217;
he used to say, &#8216;&#8217;e&#8217;s feeflee good
at spottin&#8217;.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do?&#160; Oo-oo-oo!&#160; I shouts
&#8217;Oo-oo-oo yer, yer young monkey, what yer doin&#8217;
there?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But &#8217;e was off in a flash, and I doubles
after &#8217;im prompt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you didn&#8217;t catch him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; admitted the sergeant reluctantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you catch sight of his face, sergeant?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir, &#8216;e was doublin&#8217; away in
the opposite direction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you notice anything at all about his appearance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;E was a long young chap,
sir, with a pair of legs on him&#8212;&#173;feeflee
fast &#8217;e run, sir.&#160; Oo-oo-oo, feeflee!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You noticed nothing else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;E wasn&#8217;t wearing no cap of any
sort, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bare-&#8217;eaded, sir,&#8221; added the sergeant,
rubbing the point in.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was undoubtedly the same
boy, undoubtedly!&#160; I wish you could have caught
a glimpse of his face, sergeant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would not be able to recognise
him again if you saw him, you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oo-oo-oo!&#160; Wouldn&#8217;t
go so far as to say that, sir, &#8217;cos yer see,
I&#8217;m feeflee good at spottin&#8217;, but it was
a dark night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downing rose to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the
search is now considerably narrowed down, considerably!&#160;
It is certain that the boy was one of the boys in Mr.
Outwood&#8217;s house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Young monkeys!&#8221; interjected the sergeant
helpfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-afternoon, sergeant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-afternoon to you, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray do not move, sergeant.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sergeant had not shown the slightest
inclination of doing anything of the kind.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will find my way out.&#160; Very hot to-day,
is it not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Feeflee warm, sir; weather&#8217;s goin&#8217;
to break&#8212;&#173;workin&#8217; up for thunder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not.&#160; The school
plays the M.C.C. on Wednesday, and it would be a pity
if rain were to spoil our first fixture with them.&#160;
Good afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Mr. Downing went out into the
baking sunlight, while Sergeant Collard, having requested
Mrs. Collard to take the children out for a walk at
once, and furthermore to give young Ernie a clip side
of the &#8217;ead, if he persisted in making so much
noise, put a handkerchief over his face, rested his
feet on the table, and slept the sleep of the just.</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch48">
CHAPTER XLVIII<br><br>
THE SLEUTH-HOUND</a></h3>

<p>For the Doctor Watsons of this world,
as opposed to the Sherlock Holmeses, success in the
province of detective work must always be, to a very
large extent, the result of luck.&#160; Sherlock Holmes
can extract a clue from a wisp of straw or a flake
of cigar-ash.&#160; But Doctor Watson has got to have
it taken out for him, and dusted, and exhibited clearly,
with a label attached.</p>

<p>The average man is a Doctor Watson.&#160;
We are wont to scoff in a patronising manner at that
humble follower of the great investigator, but, as
a matter of fact, we should have been just as dull
ourselves.&#160; We should not even have risen to the
modest level of a Scotland Yard Bungler.&#160; We should
simply have hung around, saying:&#160;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Holmes, how&#8212;?&#8221;
and all the rest of it, just as the downtrodden medico
did.</p>

<p>It is not often that the ordinary
person has any need to see what he can do in the way
of detection.&#160; He gets along very comfortably in
the humdrum round of life without having to measure
footprints and smile quiet, tight-lipped smiles.&#160;
But if ever the emergency does arise, he thinks naturally
of Sherlock Holmes, and his methods.</p>

<p>Mr. Downing had read all the Holmes
stories with great attention, and had thought many
times what an incompetent ass Doctor Watson was; but,
now that he had started to handle his own first case,
he was compelled to admit that there was a good deal
to be said in extenuation of Watson&#8217;s inability
to unravel tangles.&#160; It certainly was uncommonly
hard, he thought, as he paced the cricket field after
leaving Sergeant Collard, to detect anybody, unless
you knew who had really done the crime.&#160; As he
brooded over the case in hand, his sympathy for Dr.
Watson increased with every minute, and he began to
feel a certain resentment against Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle.&#160; It was all very well for Sir Arthur to
be so shrewd and infallible about tracing a mystery
to its source, but he knew perfectly well who had
done the thing before he started!</p>

<p>Now that he began really to look into
this matter of the alarm bell and the painting of
Sammy, the conviction was creeping over him that the
problem was more difficult than a casual observer might
imagine.&#160; He had got as far as finding that his
quarry of the previous night was a boy in Mr. Outwood&#8217;s
house, but how was he to get any farther?&#160; That
was the thing.&#160; There were, of course, only a limited
number of boys in Mr. Outwood&#8217;s house as tall
as the one he had pursued; but even if there had been
only one other, it would have complicated matters.&#160;
If you go to a boy and say, &#8220;Either you or Jones
were out of your house last night at twelve o&#8217;clock,&#8221;
the boy does not reply, &#8220;Sir, I cannot tell
a lie&#8212;&#173;I was out of my house last night at
twelve o&#8217;clock.&#8221;&#160; He simply assumes
the animated expression of a stuffed fish, and leaves
the next move to you.&#160; It is practically Stalemate.</p>

<p>All these things passed through Mr.
Downing&#8217;s mind as he walked up and down the
cricket field that afternoon.</p>

<p>What he wanted was a clue.&#160; But
it is so hard for the novice to tell what is a clue
and what isn&#8217;t.&#160; Probably, if he only knew,
there were clues lying all over the place, shouting
to him to pick them up.</p>

<p>What with the oppressive heat of the
day and the fatigue of hard thinking, Mr. Downing
was working up for a brain-storm, when Fate once more
intervened, this time in the shape of Riglett, a junior
member of his house.</p>

<p>Riglett slunk up in the shamefaced
way peculiar to some boys, even when they have done
nothing wrong, and, having capped Mr. Downing with
the air of one who has been caught in the act of doing
something particularly shady, requested that he might
be allowed to fetch his bicycle from the shed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your bicycle?&#8221; snapped
Mr. Downing.&#160; Much thinking had made him irritable.&#160;
&#8220;What do you want with your bicycle?&#8221;</p>

<p>Riglett shuffled, stood first on his
left foot, then on his right, blushed, and finally
remarked, as if it were not so much a sound reason
as a sort of feeble excuse for the low and blackguardly
fact that he wanted his bicycle, that he had got leave
for tea that afternoon.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Downing remembered.&#160;
Riglett had an aunt resident about three miles from
the school, whom he was accustomed to visit occasionally
on Sunday afternoons during the term.</p>

<p>He felt for his bunch of keys, and
made his way to the shed, Riglett shambling behind
at an interval of two yards.</p>

<p>Mr. Downing unlocked the door, and
there on the floor was the Clue!</p>

<p>A clue that even Dr. Watson could not have overlooked.</p>

<p>Mr. Downing saw it, but did not immediately
recognise it for what it was.&#160; What he saw at
first was not a Clue, but just a mess.&#160; He had
a tidy soul and abhorred messes.&#160; And this was
a particularly messy mess.&#160; The greater part of
the flooring in the neighbourhood of the door was
a sea of red paint.&#160; The tin from which it had
flowed was lying on its side in the middle of the
shed.&#160; The air was full of the pungent scent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pah!&#8221; said Mr. Downing.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, beneath the disguise
of the mess, he saw the clue.&#160; A foot-mark!&#160;
No less.&#160; A crimson foot-mark on the grey concrete!</p>

<p>Riglett, who had been waiting patiently
two yards away, now coughed plaintively.&#160; The
sound recalled Mr. Downing to mundane matters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get your bicycle, Riglett,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;and be careful where you tread.&#160;
Somebody has upset a pot of paint on the floor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Riglett, walking delicately through
dry places, extracted his bicycle from the rack, and
presently departed to gladden the heart of his aunt,
leaving Mr. Downing, his brain fizzing with the enthusiasm
of the detective, to lock the door and resume his
perambulation of the cricket field.</p>

<p>Give Dr. Watson a fair start, and
he is a demon at the game.&#160; Mr. Downing&#8217;s
brain was now working with a rapidity and clearness
which a professional sleuth might have envied.</p>

<p>Paint.&#160; Red paint.&#160; Obviously
the same paint with which Sammy had been decorated.&#160;
A foot-mark.&#160; Whose foot-mark?&#160; Plainly that
of the criminal who had done the deed of decoration.</p>

<p>Yoicks!</p>

<p>There were two things, however, to
be considered.&#160; Your careful detective must consider
everything.&#160; In the first place, the paint might
have been upset by the ground-man.&#160; It was the
ground-man&#8217;s paint.&#160; He had been giving
a fresh coating to the wood-work in front of the pavilion
scoring-box at the conclusion of yesterday&#8217;s
match. (A labour of love which was the direct outcome
of the enthusiasm for work which Adair had instilled
into him.) In that case the foot-mark might be his.</p>

<p><i>Note one</i>:&#160; Interview the ground-man on
this point.</p>

<p>In the second place Adair might have
upset the tin and trodden in its contents when he
went to get his bicycle in order to fetch the doctor
for the suffering MacPhee.&#160; This was the more probable
of the two contingencies, for it would have been dark
in the shed when Adair went into it.</p>

<p><i>Note two</i> Interview Adair as
to whether he found, on returning to the house, that
there was paint on his boots.</p>

<p>Things were moving.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>He resolved to take Adair first.&#160;
He could get the ground-man&#8217;s address from him.</p>

<p>Passing by the trees under whose shade
Mike and Psmith and Dunster had watched the match
on the previous day, he came upon the Head of his
house in a deck-chair reading a book.&#160; A summer
Sunday afternoon is the time for reading in deck-chairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Adair,&#8221; he said.&#160;
&#8220;No, don&#8217;t get up.&#160; I merely wished
to ask you if you found any paint on your boots when
you returned to the house last night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Paint, sir?&#8221; Adair was
plainly puzzled.&#160; His book had been interesting,
and had driven the Sammy incident out of his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see somebody has spilt some
paint on the floor of the bicycle shed.&#160; You did
not do that, I suppose, when you went to fetch your
bicycle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is spilt all over the floor.&#160;
I wondered whether you had happened to tread in it.&#160;
But you say you found no paint on your boots this
morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir, my bicycle is always
quite near the door of the shed.&#160; I didn&#8217;t
go into the shed at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see.&#160; Quite so.&#160;
Thank you, Adair.&#160; Oh, by the way, Adair, where
does Markby live?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I forget the name of his cottage,
sir, but I could show you in a second.&#160; It&#8217;s
one of those cottages just past the school gates, on
the right as you turn out into the road.&#160; There
are three in a row.&#160; His is the first you come
to.&#160; There&#8217;s a barn just before you get to
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#160; I shall be
able to find them.&#160; I should like to speak to
Markby for a moment on a small matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>A sharp walk took him to the cottages
Adair had mentioned.&#160; He rapped at the door of
the first, and the ground-man came out in his shirt-sleeves,
blinking as if he had just woke up, as was indeed
the case.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Markby!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You remember that you were
painting the scoring-box in the pavilion last night
after the match?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#160; It wanted a
lick of paint bad.&#160; The young gentlemen will scramble
about and get through the window.&#160; Makes it look
shabby, sir.&#160; So I thought I&#8217;d better give
it a coating so as to look ship-shape when the Marylebone
come down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so.&#160; An excellent
idea.&#160; Tell me, Markby, what did you do with the
pot of paint when you had finished?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put it in the bicycle shed, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the floor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the floor, sir?&#160; No.&#160;
On the shelf at the far end, with the can of whitening
what I use for marking out the wickets, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, yes.&#160; Quite so.&#160; Just as
I thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want it, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you, Markby, no,
thank you.&#160; The fact is, somebody who had no business
to do so has moved the pot of paint from the shelf
to the floor, with the result that it has been kicked
over, and spilt.&#160; You had better get some more
to-morrow.&#160; Thank you, Markby.&#160; That is all
I wished to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downing walked back to the school
thoroughly excited.&#160; He was hot on the scent now.&#160;
The only other possible theories had been tested and
successfully exploded.&#160; The thing had become simple
to a degree.&#160; All he had to do was to go to Mr.
Outwood&#8217;s house&#8212;&#173;the idea of searching
a fellow-master&#8217;s house did not appear to him
at all a delicate task; somehow one grew unconsciously
to feel that Mr. Outwood did not really exist as a
man capable of resenting liberties&#8212;&#173;find
the paint-splashed boot, ascertain its owner, and
denounce him to the headmaster.&#160; Picture, Blue
Fire and &#8220;God Save the King&#8221; by the full
strength of the company.&#160; There could be no doubt
that a paint-splashed boot must be in Mr. Outwood&#8217;s
house somewhere.&#160; A boy cannot tread in a pool
of paint without showing some signs of having done
so.&#160; It was Sunday, too, so that the boot would
not yet have been cleaned.&#160; Yoicks!&#160; Also Tally-ho!&#160;
This really was beginning to be something like business.</p>

<p>Regardless of the heat, the sleuth-hound
hurried across to Outwood&#8217;s as fast as he could
walk.</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch49">
CHAPTER XLIX<br><br>
A CHECK</a></h3>

<p>The only two members of the house
not out in the grounds when he arrived were Mike and
Psmith.&#160; They were standing on the gravel drive
in front of the boys&#8217; entrance.&#160; Mike had
a deck-chair in one hand and a book in the other.&#160;
Psmith&#8212;&#173;for even the greatest minds will
sometimes unbend&#8212;&#173;was playing diabolo.&#160;
That is to say, he was trying without success to raise
the spool from the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a kid in France,&#8221;
said Mike disparagingly, as the bobbin rolled off
the string for the fourth time, &#8220;who can do it
three thousand seven hundred and something times.&#8221;</p>

<p>Psmith smoothed a crease out of his
waistcoat and tried again.&#160; He had just succeeded
in getting the thing to spin when Mr. Downing arrived.&#160;
The sound of his footsteps disturbed Psmith and brought
the effort to nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough of this spoolery,&#8221;
said he, flinging the sticks through the open window
of the senior day-room.&#160; &#8220;I was an ass ever
to try it.&#160; The philosophical mind needs complete
repose in its hours of leisure.&#160; Hullo!&#8221;</p>

<p>He stared after the sleuth-hound,
who had just entered the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the dickens,&#8221; said
Mike, &#8220;does he mean by barging in as if he&#8217;d
bought the place?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Comrade Downing looks pleased
with himself.&#160; What brings him round in this direction,
I wonder!&#160; Still, no matter.&#160; The few articles
which he may sneak from our study are of inconsiderable
value.&#160; He is welcome to them.&#160; Do you feel
inclined to wait awhile till I have fetched a chair
and book?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be going on.&#160;
I shall be under the trees at the far end of the ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis well.&#160; I will be with you in
about two ticks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike walked on towards the field,
and Psmith, strolling upstairs to fetch his novel,
found Mr. Downing standing in the passage with the
air of one who has lost his bearings.</p>

<p>&#8220;A warm afternoon, sir,&#8221;
murmured Psmith courteously, as he passed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Er&#8212;&#173;Smith!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8212;&#173;er&#8212;&#173;wish to go round
the dormitories.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Psmith&#8217;s guiding rule
in life never to be surprised at anything, so he merely
inclined his head gracefully, and said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be glad if you would
fetch the keys and show me where the rooms are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With acute pleasure, sir,&#8221;
said Psmith.&#160; &#8220;Or shall I fetch Mr. Outwood,
sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do as I tell you, Smith,&#8221; snapped Mr.
Downing.</p>

<p>Psmith said no more, but went down
to the matron&#8217;s room.&#160; The matron being
out, he abstracted the bunch of keys from her table
and rejoined the master.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I lead the way, sir?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Downing nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, sir,&#8221; said Psmith,
opening a door, &#8220;we have Barnes&#8217; dormitory.&#160;
An airy room, constructed on the soundest hygienic
principles.&#160; Each boy, I understand, has quite
a considerable number of cubic feet of air all to
himself.&#160; It is Mr. Outwood&#8217;s boast that
no boy has ever asked for a cubic foot of air in vain.&#160;
He argues justly&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>He broke off abruptly and began to
watch the other&#8217;s manoeuvres in silence.&#160;
Mr. Downing was peering rapidly beneath each bed in
turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you looking for Barnes,
sir?&#8221; inquired Psmith politely.&#160; &#8220;I
think he&#8217;s out in the field.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downing rose, having examined
the last bed, crimson in the face with the exercise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show me the next dormitory,
Smith,&#8221; he said, panting slightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; said Psmith, opening
the next door and sinking his voice to an awed whisper,
&#8220;is where <i>I</i> sleep!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downing glanced swiftly beneath
the three beds.&#160; &#8220;Excuse me, sir,&#8221;
said Psmith, &#8220;but are we chasing anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be good enough, Smith,&#8221;
said Mr. Downing with asperity, &#8220;to keep your
remarks to yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was only wondering, sir.&#160;
Shall I show you the next in order?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>They moved on up the passage.</p>

<p>Drawing blank at the last dormitory,
Mr. Downing paused, baffled.&#160; Psmith waited patiently
by.&#160; An idea struck the master.</p>

<p>&#8220;The studies, Smith,&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aha!&#8221; said Psmith.&#160;
&#8220;I beg your pardon, sir.&#160; The observation
escaped me unawares.&#160; The frenzy of the chase
is beginning to enter into my blood.&#160; Here we
have&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downing stopped short.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this impertinence studied, Smith?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ferguson&#8217;s study, sir?&#160;
No, sir.&#160; That&#8217;s further down the passage.&#160;
This is Barnes&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downing looked at him closely.&#160;
Psmith&#8217;s face was wooden in its gravity.&#160;
The master snorted suspiciously, then moved on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whose is this?&#8221; he asked, rapping a door.</p>

<p>&#8220;This, sir, is mine and Jackson&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#160; Have you a study?&#160; You are low
down in the school for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think, sir, that Mr. Outwood
gave it us rather as a testimonial to our general
worth than to our proficiency in school-work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downing raked the room with a
keen eye.&#160; The absence of bars from the window
attracted his attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you no bars to your windows
here, such as there are in my house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There appears to be no bar,
sir,&#8221; said Psmith, putting up his eyeglass.</p>

<p>Mr Downing was leaning out of the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;A lovely view, is it not, sir?&#8221;
said Psmith.&#160; &#8220;The trees, the field, the
distant hills&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downing suddenly started.&#160;
His eye had been caught by the water-pipe at the side
of the window.&#160; The boy whom Sergeant Collard had
seen climbing the pipe must have been making for this
study.</p>

<p>He spun round and met Psmith&#8217;s
blandly inquiring gaze.&#160; He looked at Psmith carefully
for a moment.&#160; No.&#160; The boy he had chased last
night had not been Psmith.&#160; That exquisite&#8217;s
figure and general appearance were unmistakable, even
in the dusk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whom did you say you shared this study with,
Smith?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jackson, sir.&#160; The cricketer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind about his cricket,
Smith,&#8221; said Mr. Downing with irritation.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is the only other occupant of the room?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody else comes into it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If they do, they go out extremely quickly,
sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#160; Thank you, Smith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downing pondered.&#160; Jackson!&#160;
The boy bore him a grudge.&#160; The boy was precisely
the sort of boy to revenge himself by painting the
dog Sammy.&#160; And, gadzooks!&#160; The boy whom he
had pursued last night had been just about Jackson&#8217;s
size and build!</p>

<p>Mr. Downing was as firmly convinced
at that moment that Mike&#8217;s had been the hand
to wield the paint-brush as he had ever been of anything
in his life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Smith!&#8221; he said excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the spot, sir,&#8221; said Psmith affably.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are Jackson&#8217;s boots?&#8221;</p>

<p>There are moments when the giddy excitement
of being right on the trail causes the amateur (or
Watsonian) detective to be incautious.&#160; Such a
moment came to Mr. Downing then.&#160; If he had been
wise, he would have achieved his object, the getting
a glimpse of Mike&#8217;s boots, by a devious and
snaky route.&#160; As it was, he rushed straight on.</p>

<p>&#8220;His boots, sir?&#160; He has
them on.&#160; I noticed them as he went out just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the pair he wore yesterday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are the boots of yester-year?&#8221;
murmured Psmith to himself.&#160; &#8220;I should say
at a venture, sir, that they would be in the basket
downstairs.&#160; Edmund, our genial knife-and-boot
boy, collects them, I believe, at early dawn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would they have been cleaned yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I know Edmund, sir&#8212;&#173;no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Smith,&#8221; said Mr. Downing,
trembling with excitement, &#8220;go and bring that
basket to me here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Psmith&#8217;s brain was working rapidly
as he went downstairs.&#160; What exactly was at the
back of the sleuth&#8217;s mind, prompting these manoeuvres,
he did not know.&#160; But that there was something,
and that that something was directed in a hostile
manner against Mike, probably in connection with last
night&#8217;s wild happenings, he was certain.&#160;
Psmith had noticed, on leaving his bed at the sound
of the alarm bell, that he and Jellicoe were alone
in the room.&#160; That might mean that Mike had gone
out through the door when the bell sounded, or it might
mean that he had been out all the time.&#160; It began
to look as if the latter solution were the correct
one.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>He staggered back with the basket,
painfully conscious the while that it was creasing
his waistcoat, and dumped it down on the study floor.&#160;
Mr. Downing stooped eagerly over it.&#160; Psmith leaned
against the wall, and straightened out the damaged
garment.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have here, sir,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;a fair selection of our various bootings.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downing looked up.</p>

<p>&#8220;You dropped none of the boots on your way up,
Smith?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not one, sir.&#160; It was a fine performance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downing uttered a grunt of satisfaction,
and bent once more to his task.&#160; Boots flew about
the room.&#160; Mr. Downing knelt on the floor beside
the basket, and dug like a terrier at a rat-hole.</p>

<p>At last he made a dive, and, with
an exclamation of triumph, rose to his feet.&#160;
In his hand he held a boot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put those back again, Smith,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The ex-Etonian, wearing an expression
such as a martyr might have worn on being told off
for the stake, began to pick up the scattered footgear,
whistling softly the tune of &#8220;I do all the dirty
work,&#8221; as he did so.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the lot, sir,&#8221; he said,
rising.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah.&#160; Now come across with
me to the headmaster&#8217;s house.&#160; Leave the
basket here.&#160; You can carry it back when you return.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I put back that boot, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not.&#160; I shall take this with
me, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I carry it, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downing reflected.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Smith,&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;I think
it would be best.&#8221;</p>

<p>It occurred to him that the spectacle
of a housemaster wandering abroad on the public highway,
carrying a dirty boot, might be a trifle undignified.&#160;
You never knew whom you might meet on Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>Psmith took the boot, and doing so,
understood what before had puzzled him.</p>

<p>Across the toe of the boot was a broad splash of red
paint.</p>

<p>He knew nothing, of course, of the
upset tin in the bicycle shed; but when a housemaster&#8217;s
dog has been painted red in the night, and when, on
the following day, the housemaster goes about in search
of a paint-splashed boot, one puts two and two together.&#160;
Psmith looked at the name inside the boot.&#160; It
was &#8220;Brown, boot-maker, Bridgnorth.&#8221;&#160;
Bridgnorth was only a few miles from his own home and
Mike&#8217;s.&#160; Undoubtedly it was Mike&#8217;s
boot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you tell me whose boot that is?&#8221;
asked Mr. Downing.</p>

<p>Psmith looked at it again.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#160; I can&#8217;t say the little
chap&#8217;s familiar to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come with me, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downing left the room.&#160; After a moment Psmith
followed him.</p>

<p>The headmaster was in his garden.&#160;
Thither Mr. Downing made his way, the boot-bearing
Psmith in close attendance.</p>

<p>The Head listened to the amateur detective&#8217;s
statement with interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed?&#8221; he said, when Mr. Downing had
finished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed?&#160; Dear me!&#160;
It certainly seems&#8212;&#173;It is a curiously well-connected
thread of evidence.&#160; You are certain that there
was red paint on this boot you discovered in Mr. Outwood&#8217;s
house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have it with me.&#160; I brought it on purpose
to show to you.&#160; Smith!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have the boot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said the headmaster,
putting on a pair of pince-nez, &#8220;now let me
look at&#8212;&#173;This, you say, is the&#8212;?&#160;
Just so.&#160; Just so.&#160; Just....&#160; But, er,
Mr. Downing, it may be that I have not examined this
boot with sufficient care, but&#8212;&#173;Can <i>you</i>
point out to me exactly where this paint is that you
speak of?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downing stood staring at the boot
with a wild, fixed stare.&#160; Of any suspicion of
paint, red or otherwise, it was absolutely and entirely
innocent.</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch50">
CHAPTER L<br><br>
THE DESTROYER OF EVIDENCE</a></h3>

<p>The boot became the centre of attraction,
the cynosure of all eyes.&#160; Mr. Downing fixed it
with the piercing stare of one who feels that his
brain is tottering.&#160; The headmaster looked at it
with a mildly puzzled expression.&#160; Psmith, putting
up his eyeglass, gazed at it with a sort of affectionate
interest, as if he were waiting for it to do a trick
of some kind.</p>

<p>Mr. Downing was the first to break the silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was paint on this boot,&#8221;
he said vehemently.&#160; &#8220;I tell you there was
a splash of red paint across the toe.&#160; Smith will
bear me out in this.&#160; Smith, you saw the paint
on this boot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Paint, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#160; Do you mean to tell me that you
did <i>not</i> see it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#160; There was no paint on this boot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is foolery.&#160; I saw
it with my own eyes.&#160; It was a broad splash right
across the toe.&#8221;</p>

<p>The headmaster interposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have made a mistake,
Mr. Downing.&#160; There is certainly no trace of paint
on this boot.&#160; These momentary optical delusions
are, I fancy, not uncommon.&#160; Any doctor will tell
you&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had an aunt, sir,&#8221;
said Psmith chattily, &#8220;who was remarkably subject&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is absurd.&#160; I cannot
have been mistaken,&#8221; said Mr. Downing.&#160; &#8220;I
am positively certain the toe of this boot was red
when I found it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is undoubtedly black now, Mr. Downing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A sort of chameleon boot,&#8221; murmured Psmith.</p>

<p>The goaded housemaster turned on him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you say, Smith?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I speak, sir?&#8221; said
Psmith, with the start of one coming suddenly out
of a trance.</p>

<p>Mr. Downing looked searchingly at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better be careful, Smith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I strongly suspect you of having something
to do with this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, Mr. Downing,&#8221;
said the headmaster, &#8220;that is surely improbable.&#160;
Smith could scarcely have cleaned the boot on his way
to my house.&#160; On one occasion I inadvertently
spilt some paint on a shoe of my own.&#160; I can assure
you that it does not brush off.&#160; It needs a very
systematic cleaning before all traces are removed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly, sir,&#8221; said Psmith.&#160; &#8220;My
theory, if I may&#8212;&#8212;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, Smith.&#8221;</p>

<p>Psmith bowed courteously and proceeded.</p>

<p>&#8220;My theory, sir, is that Mr.
Downing was deceived by the light and shade effects
on the toe of the boot.&#160; The afternoon sun, streaming
in through the window, must have shone on the boot
in such a manner as to give it a momentary and fictitious
aspect of redness.&#160; If Mr. Downing recollects,
he did not look long at the boot.&#160; The picture
on the retina of the eye, consequently, had not time
to fade.&#160; I remember thinking myself, at the moment,
that the boot appeared to have a certain reddish tint.&#160;
The mistake&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; said Mr. Downing shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, really,&#8221; said the
headmaster, &#8220;it seems to me that that is the
only explanation that will square with the facts.&#160;
A boot that is really smeared with red paint does
not become black of itself in the course of a few
minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very right, sir,&#8221;
said Psmith with benevolent approval.&#160; &#8220;May
I go now, sir?&#160; I am in the middle of a singularly
impressive passage of Cicero&#8217;s speech De Senectute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry that you should
leave your preparation till Sunday, Smith.&#160; It
is a habit of which I altogether disapprove.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am reading it, sir,&#8221;
said Psmith, with simple dignity, &#8220;for pleasure.&#160;
Shall I take the boot with me, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If Mr. Downing does not want it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The housemaster passed the fraudulent
piece of evidence to Psmith without a word, and the
latter, having included both masters in a kindly smile,
left the garden.</p>

<p>Pedestrians who had the good fortune
to be passing along the road between the housemaster&#8217;s
house and Mr. Outwood&#8217;s at that moment saw what,
if they had but known it, was a most unusual sight,
the spectacle of Psmith running.&#160; Psmith&#8217;s
usual mode of progression was a dignified walk.&#160;
He believed in the contemplative style rather than
the hustling.</p>

<p>On this occasion, however, reckless
of possible injuries to the crease of his trousers,
he raced down the road, and turning in at Outwood&#8217;s
gate, bounded upstairs like a highly trained professional
athlete.</p>

<p>On arriving at the study, his first
act was to remove a boot from the top of the pile
in the basket, place it in the small cupboard under
the bookshelf, and lock the cupboard.&#160; Then he
flung himself into a chair and panted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brain,&#8221; he said to himself
approvingly, &#8220;is what one chiefly needs in matters
of this kind.&#160; Without brain, where are we?&#160;
In the soup, every time.&#160; The next development
will be when Comrade Downing thinks it over, and is
struck with the brilliant idea that it&#8217;s just
possible that the boot he gave me to carry and the
boot I did carry were not one boot but two boots.&#160;
Meanwhile&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>He dragged up another chair for his
feet and picked up his novel.</p>

<p>He had not been reading long when
there was a footstep in the passage, and Mr. Downing
appeared.</p>

<p>The possibility, in fact the probability,
of Psmith having substituted another boot for the
one with the incriminating splash of paint on it had
occurred to him almost immediately on leaving the headmaster&#8217;s
garden.&#160; Psmith and Mike, he reflected, were friends.&#160;
Psmith&#8217;s impulse would be to do all that lay
in his power to shield Mike.&#160; Feeling aggrieved
with himself that he had not thought of this before,
he, too, hurried over to Outwood&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Mr. Downing was brisk and peremptory.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to look at these boots
again,&#8221; he said.&#160; Psmith, with a sigh, laid
down his novel, and rose to assist him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, Smith,&#8221; said
the housemaster.&#160; &#8220;I can manage without your
help.&#8221;</p>

<p>Psmith sat down again, carefully tucking
up the knees of his trousers, and watched him with
silent interest through his eyeglass.</p>

<p>The scrutiny irritated Mr. Downing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put that thing away, Smith,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;That thing, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that ridiculous glass.&#160; Put it away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why!&#160; Because I tell you to do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guessed that that was the
reason, sir,&#8221; sighed Psmith replacing the eyeglass
in his waistcoat pocket.&#160; He rested his elbows
on his knees, and his chin on his hands, and resumed
his contemplative inspection of the boot-expert, who,
after fidgeting for a few moments, lodged another
complaint.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t sit there staring at me, Smith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was interested in what you were doing, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind.&#160; Don&#8217;t stare at me in
that idiotic way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I read, sir?&#8221; asked Psmith, patiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, read if you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Psmith took up his book again, and
Mr. Downing, now thoroughly irritated, pursued his
investigations in the boot-basket.</p>

<p>He went through it twice, but each
time without success.&#160; After the second search,
he stood up, and looked wildly round the room.&#160;
He was as certain as he could be of anything that
the missing piece of evidence was somewhere in the
study.&#160; It was no use asking Psmith point-blank
where it was, for Psmith&#8217;s ability to parry dangerous
questions with evasive answers was quite out of the
common.</p>

<p>His eye roamed about the room.&#160;
There was very little cover there, even for so small
a fugitive as a number nine boot.&#160; The floor could
be acquitted, on sight, of harbouring the quarry.</p>

<p>Then he caught sight of the cupboard,
and something seemed to tell him that there was the
place to look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Smith!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Psmith had been reading placidly all the while.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is in this cupboard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That cupboard, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#160; This cupboard.&#8221;&#160; Mr. Downing
rapped the door irritably.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a few odd trifles, sir.&#160;
We do not often use it.&#160; A ball of string, perhaps.&#160;
Possibly an old note-book.&#160; Nothing of value or
interest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Open it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you will find that it is locked, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unlock it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But where is the key, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you not got the key?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If the key is not in the lock,
sir, you may depend upon it that it will take a long
search to find it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you see it last?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was in the lock yesterday morning.&#160;
Jackson might have taken it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Jackson?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Out in the field somewhere, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downing thought for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe a word
of it,&#8221; he said shortly.&#160; &#8220;I have my
reasons for thinking that you are deliberately keeping
the contents of that cupboard from me.&#160; I shall
break open the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>Psmith got up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you mustn&#8217;t do that,
sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downing stared, amazed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you aware whom you are talking to, Smith?&#8221;
he inquired acidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#160; And I know it&#8217;s
not Mr. Outwood, to whom that cupboard happens to
belong.&#160; If you wish to break it open, you must
get his permission.&#160; He is the sole lessee and
proprietor of that cupboard.&#160; I am only the acting
manager.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downing paused.&#160; He also reflected.&#160;
Mr. Outwood in the general rule did not count much
in the scheme of things, but possibly there were limits
to the treating of him as if he did not exist.&#160;
To enter his house without his permission and search
it to a certain extent was all very well.&#160; But
when it came to breaking up his furniture, perhaps&#8212;&#8212;!</p>

<p>On the other hand, there was the maddening
thought that if he left the study in search of Mr.
Outwood, in order to obtain his sanction for the house-breaking
work which he proposed to carry through, Smith would
be alone in the room.&#160; And he knew that, if Smith
were left alone in the room, he would instantly remove
the boot to some other hiding-place.&#160; He thoroughly
disbelieved the story of the lost key.&#160; He was
perfectly convinced that the missing boot was in the
cupboard.</p>

<p>He stood chewing these thoughts for
awhile, Psmith in the meantime standing in a graceful
attitude in front of the cupboard, staring into vacancy.</p>

<p>Then he was seized with a happy idea.&#160;
Why should he leave the room at all?&#160; If he sent
Smith, then he himself could wait and make certain
that the cupboard was not tampered with.</p>

<p>&#8220;Smith,&#8221; he said, &#8220;go
and find Mr. Outwood, and ask him to be good enough
to come here for a moment.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch51">
CHAPTER LI<br><br>
MAINLY ABOUT BOOTS</a></h3>

<p>&#8220;Be quick, Smith,&#8221; he
said, as the latter stood looking at him without making
any movement in the direction of the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Quick</i>, sir?&#8221; said
Psmith meditatively, as if he had been asked a conundrum.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go and find Mr. Outwood at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Psmith still made no move.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you intend to disobey me, Smith?&#8221;
Mr. Downing&#8217;s voice was steely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was one of those you-could-have-heard-a-pin-drop
silences.&#160; Psmith was staring reflectively at
the ceiling.&#160; Mr. Downing was looking as if at
any moment he might say, &#8220;Thwarted to me face,
ha, ha!&#160; And by a very stripling!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Psmith, however, who resumed
the conversation.&#160; His manner was almost too respectful;
which made it all the more a pity that what he said
did not keep up the standard of docility.</p>

<p>&#8220;I take my stand,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;on a technical point.&#160; I say to myself,
&#8217;Mr. Downing is a man I admire as a human being
and respect as a master.&#160; In&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This impertinence is doing you no good, Smith.&#8221;</p>

<p>Psmith waved a hand deprecatingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will let me explain,
sir.&#160; I was about to say that in any other place
but Mr. Outwood&#8217;s house, your word would be law.&#160;
I would fly to do your bidding.&#160; If you pressed
a button, I would do the rest.&#160; But in Mr. Outwood&#8217;s
house I cannot do anything except what pleases me
or what is ordered by Mr. Outwood.&#160; I ought to
have remembered that before.&#160; One cannot,&#8221;
he continued, as who should say, &#8220;Let us be
reasonable,&#8221; &#8220;one cannot, to take a parallel
case, imagine the colonel commanding the garrison
at a naval station going on board a battleship and
ordering the crew to splice the jibboom spanker.&#160;
It might be an admirable thing for the Empire that
the jibboom spanker <i>should</i> be spliced at that
particular juncture, but the crew would naturally
decline to move in the matter until the order came
from the commander of the ship.&#160; So in my case.&#160;
If you will go to Mr. Outwood, and explain to him
how matters stand, and come back and say to me, &#8217;Psmith,
Mr. Outwood wishes you to ask him to be good enough
to come to this study,&#8217; then I shall be only
too glad to go and find him.&#160; You see my difficulty,
sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go and fetch Mr. Outwood, Smith.&#160; I shall
not tell you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Psmith flicked a speck of dust from his coat-sleeve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, Smith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can assure you, sir, at any
rate, that if there is a boot in that cupboard now,
there will be a boot there when you return.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downing stalked out of the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; added Psmith pensively
to himself, as the footsteps died away, &#8220;I did
not promise that it would be the same boot.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took the key from his pocket, unlocked
the cupboard, and took out the boot.&#160; Then he
selected from the basket a particularly battered specimen.&#160;
Placing this in the cupboard, he re-locked the door.</p>

<p>His next act was to take from the
shelf a piece of string.&#160; Attaching one end of
this to the boot that he had taken from the cupboard,
he went to the window.&#160; His first act was to fling
the cupboard-key out into the bushes.&#160; Then he
turned to the boot.&#160; On a level with the sill
the water-pipe, up which Mike had started to climb
the night before, was fastened to the wall by an iron
band.&#160; He tied the other end of the string to
this, and let the boot swing free.&#160; He noticed
with approval, when it had stopped swinging, that
it was hidden from above by the window-sill.</p>

<p>He returned to his place at the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>As an after-thought he took another
boot from the basket, and thrust it up the chimney.&#160;
A shower of soot fell into the grate, blackening his
hand.</p>

<p>The bathroom was a few yards down
the corridor.&#160; He went there, and washed off the
soot.</p>

<p>When he returned, Mr. Downing was
in the study, and with him Mr. Outwood, the latter
looking dazed, as if he were not quite equal to the
intellectual pressure of the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where have you been, Smith?&#8221;
asked Mr. Downing sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been washing my hands, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; said Mr. Downing suspiciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I saw Smith go into the
bathroom,&#8221; said Mr. Outwood.&#160; &#8220;Smith,
I cannot quite understand what it is Mr. Downing wishes
me to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Outwood,&#8221; snapped
the sleuth, &#8220;I thought I had made it perfectly
clear.&#160; Where is the difficulty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot understand why you
should suspect Smith of keeping his boots in a cupboard,
and,&#8221; added Mr. Outwood with spirit, catching
sight of a Good-Gracious-has-the-man-<i>no</i>-sense
look on the other&#8217;s face,&#8221; why he should
not do so if he wishes it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly, sir,&#8221; said Psmith,
approvingly.&#160; &#8220;You have touched the spot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I must explain again, my
dear Outwood, will you kindly give me your attention
for a moment.&#160; Last night a boy broke out of your
house, and painted my dog Sampson red.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He painted&#8212;!&#8221; said Mr. Outwood,
round-eyed.&#160; &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why.&#160;
At any rate, he did.&#160; During the escapade one of
his boots was splashed with the paint.&#160; It is
that boot which I believe Smith to be concealing in
this cupboard.&#160; Now, do you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Outwood looked amazedly at Smith,
and Psmith shook his head sorrowfully at Mr. Outwood.&#160;
Psmith&#8217;a expression said, as plainly as if he
had spoken the words, &#8220;We must humour him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So with your permission, as
Smith declares that he has lost the key, I propose
to break open the door of this cupboard.&#160; Have
you any objection?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Outwood started.</p>

<p>&#8220;Objection?&#160; None at all,
my dear fellow, none at all.&#160; Let me see, <i>what</i>
is it you wish to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; said Mr. Downing shortly.</p>

<p>There was a pair of dumb-bells on
the floor, belonging to Mike.&#160; He never used them,
but they always managed to get themselves packed with
the rest of his belongings on the last day of the holidays.&#160;
Mr. Downing seized one of these, and delivered two
rapid blows at the cupboard-door.&#160; The wood splintered.&#160;
A third blow smashed the flimsy lock.&#160; The cupboard,
with any skeletons it might contain, was open for
all to view.</p>

<p>Mr. Downing uttered a cry of triumph,
and tore the boot from its resting-place.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you,&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;I told
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wondered where that boot
had got to,&#8221; said Psmith.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been looking for it for days.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downing was examining his find.&#160;
He looked up with an exclamation of surprise and wrath.</p>

<p>&#8220;This boot has no paint on it,&#8221;
he said, glaring at Psmith.&#160; &#8220;This is not
the boot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly appears, sir,&#8221;
said Psmith sympathetically, &#8220;to be free from
paint.&#160; There&#8217;s a sort of reddish glow just
there, if you look at it sideways,&#8221; he added
helpfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you place that boot there, Smith?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must have done.&#160; Then, when I lost the
key&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you satisfied now, Downing?&#8221;
interrupted Mr. Outwood with asperity, &#8220;or is
there any more furniture you wish to break?&#8221;</p>

<p>The excitement of seeing his household
goods smashed with a dumb-bell had made the archaeological
student quite a swashbuckler for the moment.&#160;
A little more, and one could imagine him giving Mr.
Downing a good, hard knock.</p>

<p>The sleuth-hound stood still for a
moment, baffled.&#160; But his brain was working with
the rapidity of a buzz-saw.&#160; A chance remark of
Mr. Outwood&#8217;s set him fizzing off on the trail
once more.&#160; Mr. Outwood had caught sight of the
little pile of soot in the grate.&#160; He bent down
to inspect it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I
must remember to have the chimneys swept.&#160; It
should have been done before.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downing&#8217;s eye, rolling in
a fine frenzy from heaven to earth, from earth to
heaven, also focussed itself on the pile of soot; and
a thrill went through him.&#160; Soot in the fireplace!&#160;
Smith washing his hands! ("You know my methods, my
dear Watson.&#160; Apply them.&#8221;)</p>

<p>Mr. Downing&#8217;s mind at that moment
contained one single thought; and that thought was
&#8220;What ho for the chimney!&#8221;</p>

<p>He dived forward with a rush, nearly
knocking Mr. Outwood off his feet, and thrust an arm
up into the unknown.&#160; An avalanche of soot fell
upon his hand and wrist, but he ignored it, for at
the same instant his fingers had closed upon what
he was seeking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;I
thought as much.&#160; You were not quite clever enough,
after all, Smith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; said Psmith
patiently.&#160; &#8220;We all make mistakes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would have done better,
Smith, not to have given me all this trouble.&#160;
You have done yourself no good by it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been great fun, though, sir,&#8221;
argued Psmith.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fun!&#8221; Mr. Downing laughed
grimly.&#160; &#8220;You may have reason to change your
opinion of what constitutes&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice failed as his eye fell on
the all-black toe of the boot.&#160; He looked up,
and caught Psmith&#8217;s benevolent gaze.&#160; He
straightened himself and brushed a bead of perspiration
from his face with the back of his hand.&#160; Unfortunately,
he used the sooty hand, and the result was like some
gruesome burlesque of a nigger minstrel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did&#8212;&#173;you&#8212;&#173;put&#8212;&#173;that&#8212;&#173;boot&#8212;&#173;there,
Smith?&#8221; he asked slowly.</p>

<center><a name="illus11">
<img src="images/jmike11.jpg" alt="&#8220;DID&#8212;&#173;YOU&#8212;&#173;PUT&#8212;&#173;THAT&#8212;&#173;BOOT&#8212;&#173;THERE, SMITH?&#8221;">
</a></center>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what did you <i>MEAN</i>
by putting it there?&#8221; roared Mr. Downing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Animal spirits, sir,&#8221; said Psmith.</p>

<p>&#8220;WHAT!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Animal spirits, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>What Mr. Downing would have replied
to this one cannot tell, though one can guess roughly.&#160;
For, just as he was opening his mouth, Mr. Outwood,
catching sight of his Chirgwin-like countenance, intervened.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Downing,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;your face.&#160; It is positively covered
with soot, positively.&#160; You must come and wash
it.&#160; You are quite black.&#160; Really, you present
a most curious appearance, most.&#160; Let me show you
the way to my room.&#8221;</p>

<p>In all times of storm and tribulation
there comes a breaking-point, a point where the spirit
definitely refuses to battle any longer against the
slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.&#160; Mr. Downing
could not bear up against this crowning blow.&#160;
He went down beneath it.&#160; In the language of the
Ring, he took the count.&#160; It was the knock-out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Soot!&#8221; he murmured weakly.&#160; &#8220;Soot!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your face is covered, my dear fellow, quite
covered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly has a faintly sooty aspect, sir,&#8221;
said Psmith.</p>

<p>His voice roused the sufferer to one last flicker
of spirit.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will hear more of this,
Smith,&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;I say you will hear
more of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he allowed Mr. Outwood to lead
him out to a place where there were towels, soap,
and sponges.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>When they had gone, Psmith went to
the window, and hauled in the string.&#160; He felt
the calm after-glow which comes to the general after
a successfully conducted battle.&#160; It had been
trying, of course, for a man of refinement, and it
had cut into his afternoon, but on the whole it had
been worth it.</p>

<p>The problem now was what to do with
the painted boot.&#160; It would take a lot of cleaning,
he saw, even if he could get hold of the necessary
implements for cleaning it.&#160; And he rather doubted
if he would be able to do so.&#160; Edmund, the boot-boy,
worked in some mysterious cell, far from the madding
crowd, at the back of the house.&#160; In the boot-cupboard
downstairs there would probably be nothing likely to
be of any use.</p>

<p>His fears were realised.&#160; The
boot-cupboard was empty.&#160; It seemed to him that,
for the time being, the best thing he could do would
be to place the boot in safe hiding, until he should
have thought out a scheme.</p>

<p>Having restored the basket to its
proper place, accordingly, he went up to the study
again, and placed the red-toed boot in the chimney,
at about the same height where Mr. Downing had found
the other.&#160; Nobody would think of looking there
a second time, and it was improbable that Mr. Outwood
really would have the chimneys swept, as he had said.&#160;
The odds were that he had forgotten about it already.</p>

<p>Psmith went to the bathroom to wash
his hands again, with the feeling that he had done
a good day&#8217;s work.</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch52">
CHAPTER LII<br><br>
ON THE TRAIL AGAIN</a></h3>

<p>The most massive minds are apt to
forget things at times.&#160; The most adroit plotters
make their little mistakes.&#160; Psmith was no exception
to the rule.&#160; He made the mistake of not telling
Mike of the afternoon&#8217;s happenings.</p>

<p>It was not altogether forgetfulness.&#160;
Psmith was one of those people who like to carry through
their operations entirely by themselves.&#160; Where
there is only one in a secret the secret is more liable
to remain unrevealed.&#160; There was nothing, he thought,
to be gained from telling Mike.&#160; He forgot what
the consequences might be if he did not.</p>

<p>So Psmith kept his own counsel, with
the result that Mike went over to school on the Monday
morning in pumps.</p>

<p>Edmund, summoned from the hinterland
of the house to give his opinion why only one of Mike&#8217;s
boots was to be found, had no views on the subject.&#160;
He seemed to look on it as one of those things which
no fellow can understand.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Ere&#8217;s one of &#8217;em,
Mr. Jackson,&#8221; he said, as if he hoped that Mike
might be satisfied with a compromise.</p>

<p>&#8220;One?&#160; What&#8217;s the
good of that, Edmund, you chump?&#160; I can&#8217;t
go over to school in one boot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edmund turned this over in his mind,
and then said, &#8220;No, sir,&#8221; as much as to
say, &#8220;I may have lost a boot, but, thank goodness,
I can still understand sound reasoning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what am I to do?&#160; Where is the other
boot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know, Mr. Jackson,&#8221; replied
Edmund to both questions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I mean&#8212;&#173;Oh, dash it, there&#8217;s
the bell.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Mike sprinted off in the pumps he stood in.</p>

<p>It is only a deviation from those
ordinary rules of school life, which one observes
naturally and without thinking, that enables one to
realise how strong public-school prejudices really
are.&#160; At a school, for instance, where the regulations
say that coats only of black or dark blue are to be
worn, a boy who appears one day in even the most respectable
and unostentatious brown finds himself looked on with
a mixture of awe and repulsion, which would be excessive
if he had sand-bagged the headmaster.&#160; So in the
case of boots.&#160; School rules decree that a boy
shall go to his form-room in boots, There is no real
reason why, if the day is fine, he should not wear
shoes, should he prefer them.&#160; But, if he does,
the thing creates a perfect sensation.&#160; Boys say,
&#8220;Great Scott, what <i>have</i> you got on?&#8221;
Masters say, &#8220;Jones, <i>what</i> are you wearing
on your feet?&#8221; In the few minutes which elapse
between the assembling of the form for call-over and
the arrival of the form-master, some wag is sure either
to stamp on the shoes, accompanying the act with some
satirical remark, or else to pull one of them off,
and inaugurate an impromptu game of football with
it.&#160; There was once a boy who went to school one
morning in elastic-sided boots....</p>

<p>Mike had always been coldly distant
in his relations to the rest of his form, looking
on them, with a few exceptions, as worms; and the
form, since his innings against Downing&#8217;s on
the Friday, had regarded Mike with respect.&#160; So
that he escaped the ragging he would have had to undergo
at Wrykyn in similar circumstances.&#160; It was only
Mr. Downing who gave trouble.</p>

<p>There is a sort of instinct which
enables some masters to tell when a boy in their form
is wearing shoes instead of boots, just as people
who dislike cats always know when one is in a room
with them.&#160; They cannot see it, but they feel
it in their bones.</p>

<p>Mr. Downing was perhaps the most bigoted
anti-shoeist in the whole list of English schoolmasters.&#160;
He waged war remorselessly against shoes.&#160; Satire,
abuse, lines, detention&#8212;&#173;every weapon was
employed by him in dealing with their wearers.&#160;
It had been the late Dunster&#8217;s practice always
to go over to school in shoes when, as he usually did,
he felt shaky in the morning&#8217;s lesson.&#160; Mr.
Downing always detected him in the first five minutes,
and that meant a lecture of anything from ten minutes
to a quarter of an hour on Untidy Habits and Boys Who
Looked like Loafers&#8212;&#173;which broke the back
of the morning&#8217;s work nicely.&#160; On one occasion,
when a particularly tricky bit of Livy was on the
bill of fare, Dunster had entered the form-room in
heel-less Turkish bath-slippers, of a vivid crimson;
and the subsequent proceedings, including his journey
over to the house to change the heel-less atrocities,
had seen him through very nearly to the quarter to
eleven interval.</p>

<p>Mike, accordingly, had not been in
his place for three minutes when Mr. Downing, stiffening
like a pointer, called his name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir?&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>What</i> are you wearing on your feet, Jackson?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pumps, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are wearing pumps?&#160;
Are you not aware that PUMPS are not the proper things
to come to school in?&#160; Why are you wearing <i>PUMPS</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>The form, leaning back against the
next row of desks, settled itself comfortably for
the address from the throne.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have lost one of my boots, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>A kind of gulp escaped from Mr. Downing&#8217;s
lips.&#160; He stared at Mike for a moment in silence.&#160;
Then, turning to Stone, he told him to start translating.</p>

<p>Stone, who had been expecting at least
ten minutes&#8217; respite, was taken unawares.&#160;
When he found the place in his book and began to construe,
he floundered hopelessly.&#160; But, to his growing
surprise and satisfaction, the form-master appeared
to notice nothing wrong.&#160; He said &#8220;Yes,
yes,&#8221; mechanically, and finally &#8220;That will
do,&#8221; whereupon Stone resumed his seat with the
feeling that the age of miracles had returned.</p>

<p>Mr. Downing&#8217;s mind was in a
whirl.&#160; His case was complete.&#160; Mike&#8217;s
appearance in shoes, with the explanation that he had
lost a boot, completed the chain.&#160; As Columbus
must have felt when his ship ran into harbour, and
the first American interviewer, jumping on board, said,
&#8220;Wal, sir, and what are your impressions of our
glorious country?&#8221; so did Mr. Downing feel at
that moment.</p>

<p>When the bell rang at a quarter to
eleven, he gathered up his gown, and sped to the headmaster.</p>

CHAPTER LIII<br><br>
THE KETTLE METHOD</a></h3>

<p>It was during the interval that day
that Stone and Robinson, discussing the subject of
cricket over a bun and ginger-beer at the school shop,
came to a momentous decision, to wit, that they were
fed up with Adair administration and meant to strike.&#160;
The immediate cause of revolt was early-morning fielding-practice,
that searching test of cricket keenness.&#160; Mike
himself, to whom cricket was the great and serious
interest of life, had shirked early-morning fielding-practice
in his first term at Wrykyn.&#160; And Stone and Robinson
had but a luke-warm attachment to the game, compared
with Mike&#8217;s.</p>

<p>As a rule, Adair had contented himself
with practice in the afternoon after school, which
nobody objects to; and no strain, consequently, had
been put upon Stone&#8217;s and Robinson&#8217;s allegiance.&#160;
In view of the M.C.C. match on the Wednesday, however,
he had now added to this an extra dose to be taken
before breakfast.&#160; Stone and Robinson had left
their comfortable beds that day at six o&#8217;clock,
yawning and heavy-eyed, and had caught catches and
fielded drives which, in the cool morning air, had
stung like adders and bitten like serpents.&#160; Until
the sun has really got to work, it is no joke taking
a high catch.&#160; Stone&#8217;s dislike of the experiment
was only equalled by Robinson&#8217;s.&#160; They were
neither of them of the type which likes to undergo
hardships for the common good.&#160; They played well
enough when on the field, but neither cared greatly
whether the school had a good season or not.&#160; They
played the game entirely for their own sakes.</p>

<p>The result was that they went back
to the house for breakfast with a never-again feeling,
and at the earliest possible moment met to debate
as to what was to be done about it.&#160; At all costs
another experience like to-day&#8217;s must be avoided.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all rot,&#8221;
said Stone.&#160; &#8220;What on earth&#8217;s the good
of sweating about before breakfast?&#160; It only makes
you tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t wonder,&#8221;
said Robinson, &#8220;if it wasn&#8217;t bad for the
heart.&#160; Rushing about on an empty stomach, I mean,
and all that sort of thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Personally,&#8221; said Stone,
gnawing his bun, &#8220;I don&#8217;t intend to stick
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor do I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean, it&#8217;s such absolute
rot.&#160; If we aren&#8217;t good enough to play for
the team without having to get up overnight to catch
catches, he&#8217;d better find somebody else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment Adair came into the shop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fielding-practice again to-morrow,&#8221; he
said briskly, &#8220;at six.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Before breakfast?&#8221; said Robinson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather.&#160; You two must buck
up, you know.&#160; You were rotten to-day.&#8221;&#160;
And he passed on, leaving the two malcontents speechless.</p>

<p>Stone was the first to recover.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hanged if I turn out to-morrow,&#8221;
he said, as they left the shop.&#160;&#8220;He can do what he likes about it.&#160; Besides,
what can he do, after all?&#160; Only kick us out of the team.&#160; And I don&#8217;t
mind that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor do I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he will
kick us out, either.&#160; He can&#8217;t play the M.C.C.
with a scratch team.&#160; If he does, we&#8217;ll go
and play for that village Jackson plays for.&#160;
We&#8217;ll get Jackson to shove us into the team.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Robinson.&#160; &#8220;Let&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Their position was a strong one.&#160;
A cricket captain may seem to be an autocrat of tremendous
power, but in reality he has only one weapon, the
keenness of those under him.&#160; With the majority,
of course, the fear of being excluded or ejected from
a team is a spur that drives.&#160; The majority, consequently,
are easily handled.&#160; But when a cricket captain
runs up against a boy who does not much care whether
he plays for the team or not, then he finds himself
in a difficult position, and, unless he is a man of
action, practically helpless.</p>

<p>Stone and Robinson felt secure.&#160;
Taking it all round, they felt that they would just
as soon play for Lower Borlock as for the school.&#160;
The bowling of the opposition would be weaker in the
former case, and the chance of making runs greater.&#160;
To a certain type of cricketer runs are runs, wherever
and however made.</p>

<p>The result of all this was that Adair,
turning out with the team next morning for fielding-practice,
found himself two short.&#160; Barnes was among those
present, but of the other two representatives of Outwood&#8217;s
house there were no signs.</p>

<p>Barnes, questioned on the subject,
had no information to give, beyond the fact that he
had not seen them about anywhere.&#160; Which was not
a great help.&#160; Adair proceeded with the fielding-practice
without further delay.</p>

<p>At breakfast that morning he was silent
and apparently wrapped in thought.&#160; Mr. Downing,
who sat at the top of the table with Adair on his
right, was accustomed at the morning meal to blend
nourishment of the body with that of the mind.&#160;
As a rule he had ten minutes with the daily paper
before the bell rang, and it was his practice to hand
on the results of his reading to Adair and the other
house-prefects, who, not having seen the paper, usually
formed an interested and appreciative audience.&#160;
To-day, however, though the house-prefects expressed
varying degrees of excitement at the news that Tyldesley
had made a century against Gloucestershire, and that
a butter famine was expected in the United States,
these world-shaking news-items seemed to leave Adair
cold.&#160; He champed his bread and marmalade with
an abstracted air.</p>

<p>He was wondering what to do in this
matter of Stone and Robinson.</p>

<p>Many captains might have passed the
thing over.&#160; To take it for granted that the missing
pair had overslept themselves would have been a safe
and convenient way out of the difficulty.&#160; But
Adair was not the sort of person who seeks for safe
and convenient ways out of difficulties.&#160; He never
shirked anything, physical or moral.</p>

<p>He resolved to interview the absentees.</p>

<p>It was not until after school that
an opportunity offered itself.&#160; He went across
to Outwood&#8217;s and found the two non-starters in
the senior day-room, engaged in the intellectual pursuit
of kicking the wall and marking the height of each
kick with chalk.&#160; Adair&#8217;s entrance coincided
with a record effort by Stone, which caused the kicker
to overbalance and stagger backwards against the captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; said Stone.&#160; &#8220;Hullo,
Adair!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mention it.&#160;
Why weren&#8217;t you two at fielding-practice this
morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>Robinson, who left the lead to Stone
in all matters, said nothing.&#160; Stone spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t turn up,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you didn&#8217;t.&#160; Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>Stone had rehearsed this scene in
his mind, and he spoke with the coolness which comes
from rehearsal.</p>

<p>&#8220;We decided not to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#160; We came to the conclusion
that we hadn&#8217;t any use for early-morning fielding.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adair&#8217;s manner became ominously calm.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were rather fed-up, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just the word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry it bored you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It didn&#8217;t.&#160; We didn&#8217;t give
it the chance to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Robinson laughed appreciatively.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the joke, Robinson?&#8221; asked
Adair.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no joke,&#8221;
said Robinson, with some haste.&#160; &#8220;I was only
thinking of something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you something else to think
about soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stone intervened.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no good making a
row about it, Adair.&#160; You must see that you can&#8217;t
do anything.&#160; Of course, you can kick us out of
the team, if you like, but we don&#8217;t care if
you do.&#160; Jackson will get us a game any Wednesday
or Saturday for the village he plays for.&#160; So we&#8217;re
all right.&#160; And the school team aren&#8217;t such
a lot of flyers that you can afford to go chucking
people out of it whenever you want to.&#160; See what
I mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You and Jackson seem to have fixed it all up
between you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#160; Kick us out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good.&#160; I thought you&#8217;d
see it was no good making a beastly row.&#160; We&#8217;ll
play for the school all right.&#160; There&#8217;s no
earthly need for us to turn out for fielding-practice
before breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think there
is?&#160; You may be right.&#160; All the same, you&#8217;re
going to to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Six sharp.&#160; Don&#8217;t be late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be an ass, Adair.&#160; We&#8217;ve
told you we aren&#8217;t going to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s only your opinion.&#160;
I think you are.&#160; I&#8217;ll give you till five
past six, as you seem to like lying in bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can turn out if you feel like it.&#160;
You won&#8217;t find me there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll be a disappointment.&#160; Nor
Robinson?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the junior
partner in the firm; but he said it without any deep
conviction.&#160; The atmosphere was growing a great
deal too tense for his comfort.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve quite made up your minds?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Stone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; said Adair quietly, and knocked
him down.</p>

<p>He was up again in a moment.&#160;
Adair had pushed the table back, and was standing
in the middle of the open space.</p>

<p>&#8220;You cad,&#8221; said Stone.&#160; &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t
ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you are now.&#160; Shall we go on?&#8221;</p>

<p>Stone dashed in without a word, and
for a few moments the two might have seemed evenly
matched to a not too intelligent spectator.&#160; But
science tells, even in a confined space.&#160; Adair
was smaller and lighter than Stone, but he was cooler
and quicker, and he knew more about the game.&#160;
His blow was always home a fraction of a second sooner
than his opponent&#8217;s.&#160; At the end of a minute
Stone was on the floor again.</p>

<p>He got up slowly and stood leaning with one hand on
the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose we say ten past six?&#8221;
said Adair.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m not particular to
a minute or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stone made no reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will ten past six suit you
for fielding-practice to-morrow?&#8221; said Adair.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Stone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks.&#160; How about you, Robinson?&#8221;</p>

<p>Robinson had been a petrified spectator
of the Captain-Kettle-like manoeuvres of the cricket
captain, and it did not take him long to make up his
mind.&#160; He was not altogether a coward.&#160; In
different circumstances he might have put up a respectable
show.&#160; But it takes a more than ordinarily courageous
person to embark on a fight which he knows must end
in his destruction.&#160; Robinson knew that he was
nothing like a match even for Stone, and Adair had
disposed of Stone in a little over one minute.&#160;
It seemed to Robinson that neither pleasure nor profit
was likely to come from an encounter with Adair.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said hastily, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
turn up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Adair.&#160;
&#8220;I wonder if either of you chaps could tell me
which is Jackson&#8217;s study.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stone was dabbing at his mouth with
a handkerchief, a task which precluded anything in
the shape of conversation; so Robinson replied that
Mike&#8217;s study was the first you came to on the
right of the corridor at the top of the stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Adair.&#160;
&#8220;You don&#8217;t happen to know if he&#8217;s
in, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He went up with Smith a quarter
of an hour ago.&#160; I don&#8217;t know if he&#8217;s
still there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go and see,&#8221;
said Adair.&#160; &#8220;I should like a word with him
if he isn&#8217;t busy.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch54">
CHAPTER LIV<br><br>
ADAIR HAS A WORD WITH MIKE</a></h3>

<p>Mike, all unconscious of the stirring
proceedings which had been going on below stairs,
was peacefully reading a letter he had received that
morning from Strachan at Wrykyn, in which the successor
to the cricket captaincy which should have been Mike&#8217;s
had a good deal to say in a lugubrious strain.&#160;
In Mike&#8217;s absence things had been going badly
with Wrykyn.&#160; A broken arm, contracted in the
course of some rash experiments with a day-boy&#8217;s
motor-bicycle, had deprived the team of the services
of Dunstable, the only man who had shown any signs
of being able to bowl a side out.&#160; Since this
calamity, wrote Strachan, everything had gone wrong.&#160;
The M.C.C., led by Mike&#8217;s brother Reggie, the
least of the three first-class-cricketing Jacksons,
had smashed them by a hundred and fifty runs.&#160;
Geddington had wiped them off the face of the earth.&#160;
The Incogs, with a team recruited exclusively from
the rabbit-hutch&#8212;&#173;not a well-known man on
the side except Stacey, a veteran who had been playing
for the club since Fuller Pilch&#8217;s time&#8212;&#173;had
got home by two wickets.&#160; In fact, it was Strachan&#8217;s
opinion that the Wrykyn team that summer was about
the most hopeless gang of dead-beats that had ever
made an exhibition of itself on the school grounds.&#160;
The Ripton match, fortunately, was off, owing to an
outbreak of mumps at that shrine of learning and athletics&#8212;&#173;the
second outbreak of the malady in two terms.&#160; Which,
said Strachan, was hard lines on Ripton, but a bit
of jolly good luck for Wrykyn, as it had saved them
from what would probably have been a record hammering,
Ripton having eight of their last year&#8217;s team
left, including Dixon, the fast bowler, against whom
Mike alone of the Wrykyn team had been able to make
runs in the previous season.&#160; Altogether, Wrykyn
had struck a bad patch.</p>

<p>Mike mourned over his suffering school.&#160;
If only he could have been there to help.&#160; It
might have made all the difference.&#160; In school
cricket one good batsman, to go in first and knock
the bowlers off their length, may take a weak team
triumphantly through a season.&#160; In school cricket
the importance of a good start for the first wicket
is incalculable.</p>

<p>As he put Strachan&#8217;s letter
away in his pocket, all his old bitterness against
Sedleigh, which had been ebbing during the past few
days, returned with a rush.&#160; He was conscious
once more of that feeling of personal injury which
had made him hate his new school on the first day
of term.</p>

<p>And it was at this point, when his
resentment was at its height, that Adair, the concrete
representative of everything Sedleighan, entered the
room.</p>

<p>There are moments in life&#8217;s
placid course when there has got to be the biggest
kind of row.&#160; This was one of them.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>Psmith, who was leaning against the
mantelpiece, reading the serial story in a daily paper
which he had abstracted from the senior day-room,
made the intruder free of the study with a dignified
wave of the hand, and went on reading.&#160; Mike remained
in the deck-chair in which he was sitting, and contented
himself with glaring at the newcomer.</p>

<p>Psmith was the first to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you ask my candid opinion,&#8221;
he said, looking up from his paper, &#8220;I should
say that young Lord Antony Trefusis was in the soup
already.&#160; I seem to see the <i>consomm&#233;</i> splashing
about his ankles.&#160; He&#8217;s had a note telling
him to be under the oak-tree in the Park at midnight.&#160;
He&#8217;s just off there at the end of this instalment.&#160;
I bet Long Jack, the poacher, is waiting there with
a sandbag.&#160; Care to see the paper, Comrade Adair?&#160;
Or don&#8217;t you take any interest in contemporary
literature?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Adair.&#160;
&#8220;I just wanted to speak to Jackson for a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fate,&#8221; said Psmith, &#8220;has
led your footsteps to the right place.&#160; That is
Comrade Jackson, the Pride of the School, sitting before
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>He suspected that Adair had come to
ask him once again to play for the school.&#160; The
fact that the M.C.C. match was on the following day
made this a probable solution of the reason for his
visit.&#160; He could think of no other errand that
was likely to have set the head of Downing&#8217;s
paying afternoon calls.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you in a minute.&#160; It won&#8217;t
take long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said Psmith approvingly,
&#8220;is right.&#160; Speed is the key-note of the
present age.&#160; Promptitude.&#160; Despatch.&#160;
This is no time for loitering.&#160; We must be strenuous.&#160;
We must hustle.&#160; We must Do It Now.&#160; We&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Buck up,&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said Adair.&#160;
&#8220;I&#8217;ve just been talking to Stone and Robinson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An excellent way of passing
an idle half-hour,&#8221; said Psmith.</p>

<p>&#8220;We weren&#8217;t exactly idle,&#8221;
said Adair grimly.&#160; &#8220;It didn&#8217;t last
long, but it was pretty lively while it did.&#160;
Stone chucked it after the first round.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike got up out of his chair.&#160;
He could not quite follow what all this was about,
but there was no mistaking the truculence of Adair&#8217;s
manner.&#160; For some reason, which might possibly
be made clear later, Adair was looking for trouble,
and Mike in his present mood felt that it would be
a privilege to see that he got it.</p>

<p>Psmith was regarding Adair through
his eyeglass with pain and surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you
do not mean us to understand that you have been <i>brawling</i>
with Comrade Stone!&#160; This is bad hearing.&#160;
I thought that you and he were like brothers.&#160;
Such a bad example for Comrade Robinson, too.&#160;
Leave us, Adair.&#160; We would brood.&#160; Oh, go thee,
knave, I&#8217;ll none of thee.&#160; Shakespeare.&#8221;</p>

<p>Psmith turned away, and resting his
elbows on the mantelpiece, gazed at himself mournfully
in the looking-glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not the man I was,&#8221;
he sighed, after a prolonged inspection.&#160; &#8220;There
are lines on my face, dark circles beneath my eyes.&#160;
The fierce rush of life at Sedleigh is wasting me
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stone and I had a discussion
about early-morning fielding-practice,&#8221; said
Adair, turning to Mike.</p>

<p>Mike said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought his fielding wanted
working up a bit, so I told him to turn out at six
to-morrow morning.&#160; He said he wouldn&#8217;t,
so we argued it out.&#160; He&#8217;s going to all
right.&#160; So is Robinson.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike remained silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;So are you,&#8221; added Adair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I get thinner and thinner,&#8221; said Psmith
from the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>Mike looked at Adair, and Adair looked
at Mike, after the manner of two dogs before they
fly at one another.&#160; There was an electric silence
in the study.&#160; Psmith peered with increased earnestness
into the glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh?&#8221; said Mike at last.&#160; &#8220;What
makes you think that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think.&#160; I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any special reason for my turning out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to play
for the school against the M.C.C. to-morrow, and
I want you to get some practice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder how you got that idea!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Curious I should have done, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very.&#160; You aren&#8217;t building on it
much, are you?&#8221; said Mike politely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am, rather,&#8221; replied Adair with equal
courtesy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll be disappointed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My eyes,&#8221; said Psmith
regretfully, &#8220;are a bit close together.&#160;
However,&#8221; he added philosophically, &#8220;it&#8217;s
too late to alter that now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike drew a step closer to Adair.</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you think I shall
play against the M.C.C.?&#8221; he asked curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to make you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike took another step forward.&#160; Adair moved to
meet him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you care to try now?&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>For just one second the two drew themselves
together preparatory to beginning the serious business
of the interview, and in that second Psmith, turning
from the glass, stepped between them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out of the light, Smith,&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>Psmith waved him back with a deprecating gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear young friends,&#8221;
he said placidly, &#8220;if you <i>will</i> let your
angry passions rise, against the direct advice of Doctor
Watts, I suppose you must, But when you propose to
claw each other in my study, in the midst of a hundred
fragile and priceless ornaments, I lodge a protest.&#160;
If you really feel that you want to scrap, for goodness
sake do it where there&#8217;s some room.&#160; I don&#8217;t
want all the study furniture smashed.&#160; I know
a bank whereon the wild thyme grows, only a few yards
down the road, where you can scrap all night if you
want to.&#160; How would it be to move on there?&#160;
Any objections?&#160; None?&#160; Then shift ho! and
let&#8217;s get it over.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch55">
CHAPTER LV<br><br>
CLEARING THE AIR</a></h3>

<p>Psmith was one of those people who
lend a dignity to everything they touch.&#160; Under
his auspices the most unpromising ventures became somehow
enveloped in an atmosphere of measured stateliness.&#160;
On the present occasion, what would have been, without
his guiding hand, a mere unscientific scramble, took
on something of the impressive formality of the National
Sporting Club.</p>

<p>&#8220;The rounds,&#8221; he said,
producing a watch, as they passed through a gate into
a field a couple of hundred yards from the house gate,
&#8220;will be of three minutes&#8217; duration, with
a minute rest in between.&#160; A man who is down will
have ten seconds in which to rise.&#160; Are you ready,
Comrades Adair and Jackson?&#160; Very well, then.&#160;
Time.&#8221;</p>

<p>After which, it was a pity that the
actual fight did not quite live up to its referee&#8217;s
introduction.&#160; Dramatically, there should have
been cautious sparring for openings and a number of
tensely contested rounds, as if it had been the final
of a boxing competition.&#160; But school fights, when
they do occur&#8212;&#173;which is only once in a decade
nowadays, unless you count junior school scuffles&#8212;&#173;are
the outcome of weeks of suppressed bad blood, and
are consequently brief and furious.&#160; In a boxing
competition, however much one may want to win, one
does not dislike one&#8217;s opponent.&#160; Up to
the moment when &#8220;time&#8221; was called, one
was probably warmly attached to him, and at the end
of the last round one expects to resume that attitude
of mind.&#160; In a fight each party, as a rule, hates
the other.</p>

<p>So it happened that there was nothing
formal or cautious about the present battle.&#160;
All Adair wanted was to get at Mike, and all Mike
wanted was to get at Adair.&#160; Directly Psmith called
&#8220;time,&#8221; they rushed together as if they
meant to end the thing in half a minute.</p>

<p>It was this that saved Mike.&#160;
In an ordinary contest with the gloves, with his opponent
cool and boxing in his true form, he could not have
lasted three rounds against Adair.&#160; The latter
was a clever boxer, while Mike had never had a lesson
in his life.&#160; If Adair had kept away and used
his head, nothing could have prevented him winning.</p>

<p>As it was, however, he threw away
his advantages, much as Tom Brown did at the beginning
of his fight with Slogger Williams, and the result
was the same as on that historic occasion.&#160; Mike
had the greater strength, and, thirty seconds from
the start, knocked his man clean off his feet with
an unscientific but powerful right-hander.</p>

<p>This finished Adair&#8217;s chances.&#160;
He rose full of fight, but with all the science knocked
out of him.&#160; He went in at Mike with both hands.&#160;
The Irish blood in him, which for the ordinary events
of life made him merely energetic and dashing, now
rendered him reckless.&#160; He abandoned all attempt
at guarding.&#160; It was the Frontal Attack in its
most futile form, and as unsuccessful as a frontal
attack is apt to be.&#160; There was a swift exchange
of blows, in the course of which Mike&#8217;s left
elbow, coming into contact with his opponent&#8217;s
right fist, got a shock which kept it tingling for
the rest of the day; and then Adair went down in a
heap.</p>

<p>He got up slowly and with difficulty.&#160;
For a moment he stood blinking vaguely.&#160; Then
he lurched forward at Mike.</p>

<p>In the excitement of a fight&#8212;&#173;which
is, after all, about the most exciting thing that
ever happens to one in the course of one&#8217;s life&#8212;&#173;it
is difficult for the fighters to see what the spectators
see.&#160; Where the spectators see an assault on an
already beaten man, the fighter himself only sees
a legitimate piece of self-defence against an opponent
whose chances are equal to his own.&#160; Psmith saw,
as anybody looking on would have seen, that Adair
was done.&#160; Mike&#8217;s blow had taken him within
a fraction of an inch of the point of the jaw, and
he was all but knocked out.&#160; Mike could not see
this.&#160; All he understood was that his man was
on his feet again and coming at him, so he hit out
with all his strength; and this time Adair went down
and stayed down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brief,&#8221; said Psmith,
coming forward, &#8220;but exciting.&#160; We may take
that, I think, to be the conclusion of the entertainment.&#160;
I will now have a dash at picking up the slain.&#160;
I shouldn&#8217;t stop, if I were you.&#160; He&#8217;ll
be sitting up and taking notice soon, and if he sees
you he may want to go on with the combat, which would
do him no earthly good.&#160; If it&#8217;s going to
be continued in our next, there had better be a bit
of an interval for alterations and repairs first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he hurt much, do you think?&#8221;
asked Mike.&#160; He had seen knock-outs before in
the ring, but this was the first time he had ever effected
one on his own account, and Adair looked unpleasantly
corpse-like.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>He&#8217;s</i> all right,&#8221;
said Psmith.&#160; &#8220;In a minute or two he&#8217;ll
be skipping about like a little lambkin.&#160; I&#8217;ll
look after him.&#160; You go away and pick flowers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike put on his coat and walked back
to the house.&#160; He was conscious of a perplexing
whirl of new and strange emotions, chief among which
was a curious feeling that he rather liked Adair.&#160;
He found himself thinking that Adair was a good chap,
that there was something to be said for his point
of view, and that it was a pity he had knocked him
about so much.&#160; At the same time, he felt an undeniable
thrill of pride at having beaten him.&#160; The feat
presented that interesting person, Mike Jackson, to
him in a fresh and pleasing light, as one who had had
a tough job to face and had carried it through.&#160;
Jackson, the cricketer, he knew, but Jackson, the
deliverer of knock-out blows, was strange to him,
and he found this new acquaintance a man to be respected.</p>

<p>The fight, in fact, had the result
which most fights have, if they are fought fairly
and until one side has had enough.&#160; It revolutionised
Mike&#8217;s view of things.&#160; It shook him up,
and drained the bad blood out of him.&#160; Where,
before, he had seemed to himself to be acting with
massive dignity, he now saw that he had simply been
sulking like some wretched kid.&#160; There had appeared
to him something rather fine in his policy of refusing
to identify himself in any way with Sedleigh, a touch
of the stone-walls-do-not-a-prison-make sort of thing.&#160;
He now saw that his attitude was to be summed up in
the words, &#8220;Sha&#8217;n&#8217;t play.&#8221;</p>

<p>It came upon Mike with painful clearness
that he had been making an ass of himself.</p>

<p>He had come to this conclusion, after
much earnest thought, when Psmith entered the study.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s Adair?&#8221; asked Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sitting up and taking nourishment
once more.&#160; We have been chatting.&#160; He&#8217;s
not a bad cove.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>There was a pause.&#160; Psmith straightened his tie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;I seldom interfere in terrestrial strife, but
it seems to me that there&#8217;s an opening here for
a capable peace-maker, not afraid of work, and willing
to give his services in exchange for a comfortable
home.&#160; Comrade Adair&#8217;s rather a stoutish
fellow in his way.&#160; I&#8217;m not much on the
&#8216;Play up for the old school, Jones,&#8217; game,
but every one to his taste.&#160; I shouldn&#8217;t
have thought anybody would get overwhelmingly attached
to this abode of wrath, but Comrade Adair seems to
have done it.&#160; He&#8217;s all for giving Sedleigh
a much-needed boost-up.&#160; It&#8217;s not a bad
idea in its way.&#160; I don&#8217;t see why one shouldn&#8217;t
humour him.&#160; Apparently he&#8217;s been sweating
since early childhood to buck the school up.&#160;
And as he&#8217;s leaving at the end of the term,
it mightn&#8217;t be a scaly scheme to give him a bit
of a send-off, if possible, by making the cricket
season a bit of a banger.&#160; As a start, why not
drop him a line to say that you&#8217;ll play against
the M.C.C. to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike did not reply at once.&#160; He
was feeling better disposed towards Adair and Sedleigh
than he had felt, but he was not sure that he was
quite prepared to go as far as a complete climb-down.</p>

<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be a bad
idea,&#8221; continued Psmith.&#160; &#8220;There&#8217;s
nothing like giving a man a bit in every now and then.&#160;
It broadens the soul and improves the action of the
skin.&#160; What seems to have fed up Comrade Adair,
to a certain extent, is that Stone apparently led him
to understand that you had offered to give him and
Robinson places in your village team.&#160; You didn&#8217;t,
of course?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; said Mike indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told him he didn&#8217;t
know the old <i>noblesse oblige</i> spirit of the
Jacksons.&#160; I said that you would scorn to tarnish
the Jackson escutcheon by not playing the game.&#160;
My eloquence convinced him.&#160; However, to return
to the point under discussion, why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t&#8212;&#173;What I mean to say&#8212;&#173;&#8221;
began Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;If your trouble is,&#8221;
said Psmith, &#8220;that you fear that you may be in
unworthy company&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be an ass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8212;&#8212;&#173;Dismiss it. <i>I</i> am
playing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike stared.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re what?&#160; You?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I,&#8221; said Psmith, breathing
on a coat-button, and polishing it with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you play cricket?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have discovered,&#8221; said Psmith, &#8220;my
secret sorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re rotting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wrong me, Comrade Jackson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why haven&#8217;t you played?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you come and play for Lower
Borlock, I mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The last time I played in a
village cricket match I was caught at point by a man
in braces.&#160; It would have been madness to risk
another such shock to my system.&#160; My nerves are
so exquisitely balanced that a thing of that sort
takes years off my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but look here, Smith, bar
rotting.&#160; Are you really any good at cricket?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Competent judges at Eton gave
me to understand so.&#160; I was told that this year
I should be a certainty for Lord&#8217;s.&#160; But
when the cricket season came, where was I?&#160; Gone.&#160;
Gone like some beautiful flower that withers in the
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you told me you didn&#8217;t
like cricket.&#160; You said you only liked watching
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite right.&#160; I do.&#160;
But at schools where cricket is compulsory you have
to overcome your private prejudices.&#160; And in time
the thing becomes a habit.&#160; Imagine my feelings
when I found that I was degenerating, little by little,
into a slow left-hand bowler with a swerve.&#160; I
fought against it, but it was useless, and after a
while I gave up the struggle, and drifted with the
stream.&#160; Last year, in a house match&#8221;&#8212;&#173;Psmith&#8217;s
voice took on a deeper tone of melancholy&#8212;&#173;&#8220;I
took seven for thirteen in the second innings on a
hard wicket.&#160; I did think, when I came here, that
I had found a haven of rest, but it was not to be.&#160;
I turn out to-morrow.&#160; What Comrade Outwood will
say, when he finds that his keenest archaeological
disciple has deserted, I hate to think.&#160; However&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike felt as if a young and powerful
earthquake had passed.&#160; The whole face of his
world had undergone a quick change.&#160; Here was he,
the recalcitrant, wavering on the point of playing
for the school, and here was Psmith, the last person
whom he would have expected to be a player, stating
calmly that he had been in the running for a place
in the Eton eleven.</p>

<p>Then in a flash Mike understood.&#160;
He was not by nature intuitive, but he read Psmith&#8217;s
mind now.&#160; Since the term began, he and Psmith
had been acting on precisely similar motives.&#160;
Just as he had been disappointed of the captaincy
of cricket at Wrykyn, so had Psmith been disappointed
of his place in the Eton team at Lord&#8217;s.&#160;
And they had both worked it off, each in his own way&#8212;&#173;Mike
sullenly, Psmith whimsically, according to their respective
natures&#8212;&#173;on Sedleigh.</p>

<p>If Psmith, therefore, did not consider
it too much of a climb-down to renounce his resolution
not to play for Sedleigh, there was nothing to stop
Mike doing so, as&#8212;&#173;at the bottom of his heart&#8212;&#173;he
wanted to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if
you&#8217;re playing, I&#8217;ll play.&#160; I&#8217;ll
write a note to Adair now.&#160; But, I say&#8212;&#173;&#8221;
he stopped&#8212;&#173;&#8220;I&#8217;m hanged if I&#8217;m
going to turn out and field before breakfast to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right.&#160;
You won&#8217;t have to.&#160; Adair won&#8217;t be
there himself.&#160; He&#8217;s not playing against
the M.C.C.&#160; He&#8217;s sprained his wrist.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch56">
CHAPTER LVI<br><br>
IN WHICH PEACE IS DECLARED</a></h3>

<p>&#8220;Sprained his wrist?&#8221; said Mike.&#160;
&#8220;How did he do that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;During the brawl.&#160; Apparently
one of his efforts got home on your elbow instead
of your expressive countenance, and whether it was
that your elbow was particularly tough or his wrist
particularly fragile, I don&#8217;t know.&#160; Anyhow,
it went.&#160; It&#8217;s nothing bad, but it&#8217;ll
keep him out of the game to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, what beastly rough luck!&#160;
I&#8217;d no idea.&#160; I&#8217;ll go round.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bad scheme.&#160; Close
the door gently after you, and if you see anybody
downstairs who looks as if he were likely to be going
over to the shop, ask him to get me a small pot of
some rare old jam and tell the man to chalk it up
to me.&#160; The jam Comrade Outwood supplies to us
at tea is all right as a practical joke or as a food
for those anxious to commit suicide, but useless to
anybody who values life.&#8221;</p>

<p>On arriving at Mr. Downing&#8217;s
and going to Adair&#8217;s study, Mike found that
his late antagonist was out.&#160; He left a note informing
him of his willingness to play in the morrow&#8217;s
match.&#160; The lock-up bell rang as he went out of
the house.</p>

<p>A spot of rain fell on his hand.&#160;
A moment later there was a continuous patter, as the
storm, which had been gathering all day, broke in
earnest.&#160; Mike turned up his coat-collar, and ran
back to Outwood&#8217;s.&#160; &#8220;At this rate,&#8221;
he said to himself, &#8220;there won&#8217;t be a match
at all to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>When the weather decides, after behaving
well for some weeks, to show what it can do in another
direction, it does the thing thoroughly.&#160; When
Mike woke the next morning the world was grey and dripping.&#160;
Leaden-coloured clouds drifted over the sky, till there
was not a trace of blue to be seen, and then the rain
began again, in the gentle, determined way rain has
when it means to make a day of it.</p>

<p>It was one of those bad days when
one sits in the pavilion, damp and depressed, while
figures in mackintoshes, with discoloured buckskin
boots, crawl miserably about the field in couples.</p>

<p>Mike, shuffling across to school in
a Burberry, met Adair at Downing&#8217;s gate.</p>

<p>These moments are always difficult.&#160;
Mike stopped&#8212;&#173;he could hardly walk on as
if nothing had happened&#8212;&#173;and looked down
at his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coming across?&#8221; he said awkwardly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right ho!&#8221; said Adair.</p>

<p>They walked on in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only about ten to, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
said Mike.</p>

<p>Adair fished out his watch, and examined
it with an elaborate care born of nervousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;About nine to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good.&#160; We&#8217;ve got plenty of time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate having to hurry over to school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I often do cut it rather fine, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#160; So do I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beastly nuisance when one does.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beastly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only about a couple
of minutes from the houses to the school, I should
think, shouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much more.&#160; Might be three.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#160; Three if one didn&#8217;t hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, if one didn&#8217;t hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beastly day,&#8221; said Adair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rotten.&#8221;</p>

<p>Silence again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; said Mike, scowling
at his toes, &#8220;awfully sorry about your wrist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right.&#160; It was my
fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does it hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, rather not, thanks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d no idea you&#8217;d crocked yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, that&#8217;s all right.&#160;
It was only right at the end.&#160; You&#8217;d have
smashed me anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, rot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I bet you anything you like you would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I bet you I shouldn&#8217;t....&#160; Jolly
hard luck, just before the match.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no....&#160; I say, thanks awfully for saying
you&#8217;d play.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, rot....&#160; Do you think we shall get
a game?&#8221;</p>

<p>Adair inspected the sky carefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#160; It looks pretty bad,
doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rotten.&#160; I say, how long will your wrist
keep you out of cricket?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be all right in a week.&#160; Less, probably.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that you and Smith are
going to play, we ought to have a jolly good season.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rummy, Smith turning out to be a cricketer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#160; I should think he&#8217;d be a hot
bowler, with his height.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must be jolly good if he
was only just out of the Eton team last year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the time?&#8221; asked Mike.</p>

<p>Adair produced his watch once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Five to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve heaps of time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, heaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s stroll on a bit down the road,
shall we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right ho!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike cleared his throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been talking to
Smith.&#160; He was telling me that you thought I&#8217;d
promised to give Stone and Robinson places in the&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, that&#8217;s all right.&#160;
It was only for a bit.&#160; Smith told me you couldn&#8217;t
have done, and I saw that I was an ass to think you
could have.&#160; It was Stone seeming so dead certain
that he could play for Lower Borlock if I chucked
him from the school team that gave me the idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He never even asked me to get him a place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, I wouldn&#8217;t have done it, even
if he had.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to play
myself, but I wasn&#8217;t going to do a rotten trick
like getting other fellows away from the team.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was rotten enough, really, not playing myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no.&#160; Beastly rough
luck having to leave Wrykyn just when you were going
to be captain, and come to a small school like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>The excitement of the past few days
must have had a stimulating effect on Mike&#8217;s
mind&#8212;&#173;shaken it up, as it were:&#160; for
now, for the second time in two days, he displayed
quite a creditable amount of intuition.&#160; He might
have been misled by Adair&#8217;s apparently deprecatory
attitude towards Sedleigh, and blundered into a denunciation
of the place.&#160; Adair had said &#8220;a small school
like this&#8221; in the sort of voice which might
have led his hearer to think that he was expected to
say, &#8220;Yes, rotten little hole, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
or words to that effect.&#160; Mike, fortunately, perceived
that the words were used purely from politeness, on
the Chinese principle.&#160; When a Chinaman wishes
to pay a compliment, he does so by belittling himself
and his belongings.</p>

<p>He eluded the pitfall.</p>

<p>&#8220;What rot!&#8221; he said.&#160;
&#8220;Sedleigh&#8217;s one of the most sporting schools
I&#8217;ve ever come across.&#160; Everybody&#8217;s
as keen as blazes.&#160; So they ought to be, after
the way you&#8217;ve sweated.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adair shuffled awkwardly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always been fairly
keen on the place,&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;But
I don&#8217;t suppose I&#8217;ve done anything much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve loosened one of
my front teeth,&#8221; said Mike, with a grin, &#8220;if
that&#8217;s any comfort to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t eat anything
except porridge this morning.&#160; My jaw still aches.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the first time during the conversation
their eyes met, and the humorous side of the thing
struck them simultaneously.&#160; They began to laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;What fools we must have looked!&#8221; said
Adair.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> were all right.&#160;
I must have looked rotten.&#160; I&#8217;ve never had
the gloves on in my life.&#160; I&#8217;m jolly glad
no one saw us except Smith, who doesn&#8217;t count.&#160;
Hullo, there&#8217;s the bell.&#160; We&#8217;d better
be moving on.&#160; What about this match?&#160; Not
much chance of it from the look of the sky at present.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might clear before eleven.&#160;
You&#8217;d better get changed, anyhow, at the interval,
and hang about in case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right.&#160; It&#8217;s
better than doing Thucydides with Downing.&#160; We&#8217;ve
got math, till the interval, so I don&#8217;t see
anything of him all day; which won&#8217;t hurt me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t a bad sort of
chap, when you get to know him,&#8221; said Adair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t have done, then.&#160;
I don&#8217;t know which I&#8217;d least soon be,
Downing or a black-beetle, except that if one was Downing
one could tread on the black-beetle.&#160; Dash this
rain.&#160; I got about half a pint down my neck just
then.&#160; We sha&#8217;n&#8217;t get a game to-day,
of anything like it.&#160; As you&#8217;re crocked,
I&#8217;m not sure that I care much.&#160; You&#8217;ve
been sweating for years to get the match on, and it
would be rather rot playing it without you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that so
much.&#160; I wish we could play, because I&#8217;m
certain, with you and Smith, we&#8217;d walk into
them.&#160; They probably aren&#8217;t sending down
much of a team, and really, now that you and Smith
are turning out, we&#8217;ve got a jolly hot lot.&#160;
There&#8217;s quite decent batting all the way through,
and the bowling isn&#8217;t so bad.&#160; If only we
could have given this M.C.C. lot a really good hammering,
it might have been easier to get some good fixtures
for next season.&#160; You see, it&#8217;s all right
for a school like Wrykyn, but with a small place like
this you simply can&#8217;t get the best teams to
give you a match till you&#8217;ve done something to
show that you aren&#8217;t absolute rotters at the
game.&#160; As for the schools, they&#8217;re worse.&#160;
They&#8217;d simply laugh at you.&#160; You were cricket
secretary at Wrykyn last year.&#160; What would you
have done if you&#8217;d had a challenge from Sedleigh?&#160;
You&#8217;d either have laughed till you were sick,
or else had a fit at the mere idea of the thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, you&#8217;ve struck
about the brightest scheme on record.&#160; I never
thought of it before.&#160; Let&#8217;s get a match
on with Wrykyn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#160; They wouldn&#8217;t play us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they would.&#160; At least,
I&#8217;m pretty sure they would.&#160; I had a letter
from Strachan, the captain, yesterday, saying that
the Ripton match had had to be scratched owing to
illness.&#160; So they&#8217;ve got a vacant date.&#160;
Shall I try them?&#160; I&#8217;ll write to Strachan
to-night, if you like.&#160; And they aren&#8217;t
strong this year.&#160; We&#8217;ll smash them.&#160;
What do you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>Adair was as one who has seen a vision.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove,&#8221; he said at last, &#8220;if
we only could!&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch57">
CHAPTER LVII<br><br>
MR. DOWNING MOVES</a></h3>

<p>The rain continued without a break
all the morning.&#160; The two teams, after hanging
about dismally, and whiling the time away with stump-cricket
in the changing-rooms, lunched in the pavilion at
one o&#8217;clock.&#160; After which the M.C.C. captain,
approaching Adair, moved that this merry meeting be
considered off and himself and his men permitted to
catch the next train back to town.&#160; To which Adair,
seeing that it was out of the question that there should
be any cricket that afternoon, regretfully agreed,
and the first Sedleigh <i>v</i>.&#160; M.C.C. match
was accordingly scratched.</p>

<p>Mike and Psmith, wandering back to
the house, were met by a damp junior from Downing&#8217;s,
with a message that Mr. Downing wished to see Mike
as soon as he was changed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he want me for?&#8221; inquired
Mike.</p>

<p>The messenger did not know.&#160; Mr.
Downing, it seemed, had not confided in him.&#160;
All he knew was that the housemaster was in the house,
and would be glad if Mike would step across.</p>

<p>&#8220;A nuisance,&#8221; said Psmith,
&#8220;this incessant demand for you.&#160; That&#8217;s
the worst of being popular.&#160; If he wants you to
stop to tea, edge away.&#160; A meal on rather a sumptuous
scale will be prepared in the study against your return.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike changed quickly, and went off,
leaving Psmith, who was fond of simple pleasures in
his spare time, earnestly occupied with a puzzle which
had been scattered through the land by a weekly paper.&#160;
The prize for a solution was one thousand pounds,
and Psmith had already informed Mike with some minuteness
of his plans for the disposition of this sum.&#160;
Meanwhile, he worked at it both in and out of school,
generally with abusive comments on its inventor.</p>

<p>He was still fiddling away at it when Mike returned.</p>

<p>Mike, though Psmith was at first too
absorbed to notice it, was agitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish to be in
any way harsh,&#8221; said Psmith, without looking
up, &#8220;but the man who invented this thing was
a blighter of the worst type.&#160; You come and have
a shot.&#160; For the moment I am baffled.&#160; The
whisper flies round the clubs, &#8216;Psmith is baffled.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man&#8217;s an absolute
drivelling ass,&#8221; said Mike warmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me, do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth would be the point of my doing
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d gather in a thousand
of the best.&#160; Give you a nice start in life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not talking about your rotten puzzle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That ass Downing.&#160; I believe he&#8217;s
off his nut.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then your chat with Comrade
Downing was not of the old-College-chums-meeting-unexpectedly-after-years&#8217;-separation
type?&#160; What has he been doing to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s off his nut.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know.&#160; But what did he
do?&#160; How did the brainstorm burst?&#160; Did he
jump at you from behind a door and bite a piece out
of your leg, or did he say he was a tea-pot?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike sat down.</p>

<p>&#8220;You remember that painting Sammy business?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As if it were yesterday,&#8221; said Psmith.&#160;
&#8220;Which it was, pretty nearly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He thinks I did it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#160; Have you ever shown any talent in
the painting line?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The silly ass wanted me to
confess that I&#8217;d done it.&#160; He as good as
asked me to.&#160; Jawed a lot of rot about my finding
it to my advantage later on if I behaved sensibly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what are you worrying
about?&#160; Don&#8217;t you know that when a master
wants you to do the confessing-act, it simply means
that he hasn&#8217;t enough evidence to start in on
you with?&#160; You&#8217;re all right.&#160; The thing&#8217;s
a stand-off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Evidence!&#8221; said Mike,
&#8220;My dear man, he&#8217;s got enough evidence
to sink a ship.&#160; He&#8217;s absolutely sweating
evidence at every pore.&#160; As far as I can see,
he&#8217;s been crawling about, doing the Sherlock
Holmes business for all he&#8217;s worth ever since
the thing happened, and now he&#8217;s dead certain
that I painted Sammy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Did</i> you, by the way?&#8221; asked Psmith.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Mike shortly,
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t.&#160; But after listening to
Downing I almost began to wonder if I hadn&#8217;t.&#160;
The man&#8217;s got stacks of evidence to prove that
I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such as what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mostly about my
boots.&#160; But, dash it, you know all about that.&#160;
Why, you were with him when he came and looked for
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true,&#8221; said Psmith,
&#8220;that Comrade Downing and I spent a very pleasant
half-hour together inspecting boots, but how does he
drag you into it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He swears one of the boots was splashed with
paint.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#160; He babbled to some
extent on that point when I was entertaining him.&#160;
But what makes him think that the boot, if any, was
yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s certain that somebody
in this house got one of his boots splashed, and is
hiding it somewhere.&#160; And I&#8217;m the only chap
in the house who hasn&#8217;t got a pair of boots
to show, so he thinks it&#8217;s me.&#160; I don&#8217;t
know where the dickens my other boot has gone.&#160;
Edmund swears he hasn&#8217;t seen it, and it&#8217;s
nowhere about.&#160; Of course I&#8217;ve got two pairs,
but one&#8217;s being soled.&#160; So I had to go over
to school yesterday in pumps.&#160; That&#8217;s how
he spotted me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Psmith sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Comrade Jackson,&#8221; he
said mournfully, &#8220;all this very sad affair shows
the folly of acting from the best motives.&#160; In
my simple zeal, meaning to save you unpleasantness,
I have landed you, with a dull, sickening thud, right
in the cart.&#160; Are you particular about dirtying
your hands?&#160; If you aren&#8217;t, just reach up
that chimney a bit?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike stared, &#8220;What the dickens are you talking
about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on.&#160; Get it over.&#160; Be a man, and
reach up the chimney.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what the
game is,&#8221; said Mike, kneeling beside the fender
and groping, &#8220;but&#8212;&#173;<i>Hullo</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah ha!&#8221; said Psmith moodily.</p>

<p>Mike dropped the soot-covered object in the fender,
and glared at it.</p>

<center><a name="illus12">
<img src="images/jmike12.jpg" alt="MIKE DROPPED THE SOOT-COVERED OBJECT IN THE FENDER">
</a></center>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my boot!&#8221; he said at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i>,&#8221; said Psmith,
&#8220;your boot.&#160; And what is that red stain
across the toe?&#160; Is it blood?&#160; No, &#8217;tis
not blood.&#160; It is red paint.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike seemed unable to remove his eyes from the boot.</p>

<p>&#8220;How on earth did&#8212;&#173;By
Jove!&#160; I remember now.&#160; I kicked up against
something in the dark when I was putting my bicycle
back that night.&#160; It must have been the paint-pot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you were out that night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather.&#160; That&#8217;s what
makes it so jolly awkward.&#160; It&#8217;s too long
to tell you now&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your stories are never too long for me,&#8221;
said Psmith.&#160; &#8220;Say on!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it was like this.&#8221;&#160;
And Mike related the events which had led up to his
midnight excursion.&#160; Psmith listened attentively.</p>

<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; he said, when
Mike had finished, &#8220;confirms my frequently stated
opinion that Comrade Jellicoe is one of Nature&#8217;s
blitherers.&#160; So that&#8217;s why he touched us
for our hard-earned, was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#160; Of course there was
no need for him to have the money at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the result is that you
are in something of a tight place.&#160; You&#8217;re
<i>absolutely</i> certain you didn&#8217;t paint that
dog?&#160; Didn&#8217;t do it, by any chance, in a
moment of absent-mindedness, and forgot all about it?&#160;
No?&#160; No, I suppose not.&#160; I wonder who did!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s beastly awkward.&#160;
You see, Downing chased me that night.&#160; That was
why I rang the alarm bell.&#160; So, you see, he&#8217;s
certain to think that the chap he chased, which was
me, and the chap who painted Sammy, are the same.&#160;
I shall get landed both ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>Psmith pondered.</p>

<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> a tightish place,&#8221; he admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if we could get this
boot clean,&#8221; said Mike, inspecting it with disfavour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for a pretty considerable time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose not.&#160; I say,
I <i>am</i> in the cart.&#160; If I can&#8217;t produce
this boot, they&#8217;re bound to guess why.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What exactly,&#8221; asked
Psmith, &#8220;was the position of affairs between
you and Comrade Downing when you left him?&#160; Had
you definitely parted brass-rags?&#160; Or did you
simply sort of drift apart with mutual courtesies?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he said I was ill-advised
to continue that attitude, or some rot, and I said
I didn&#8217;t care, I hadn&#8217;t painted his bally
dog, and he said very well, then, he must take steps,
and&#8212;&#173;well, that was about all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sufficient, too,&#8221; said
Psmith, &#8220;quite sufficient.&#160; I take it, then,
that he is now on the war-path, collecting a gang,
so to speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose he&#8217;s gone to the Old Man about
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably.&#160; A very worrying
time our headmaster is having, taking it all round,
in connection with this painful affair.&#160; What do
you think his move will be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose he&#8217;ll send
for me, and try to get something out of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>He&#8217;ll</i> want you
to confess, too.&#160; Masters are all whales on confession.&#160;
The worst of it is, you can&#8217;t prove an alibi,
because at about the time the foul act was perpetrated,
you were playing Round-and-round-the-mulberry-bush
with Comrade Downing.&#160; This needs thought.&#160;
You had better put the case in my hands, and go out
and watch the dandelions growing.&#160; I will think
over the matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hope you&#8217;ll be
able to think of something.&#160; I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly.&#160; You never know.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a tap at the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;See how we have trained them,&#8221;
said Psmith.&#160; &#8220;They now knock before entering.&#160;
There was a time when they would have tried to smash
in a panel.&#160; Come in.&#8221;</p>

<p>A small boy, carrying a straw hat
adorned with the school-house ribbon, answered the
invitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I say, Jackson,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;the headmaster sent me over to tell
you he wants to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you so,&#8221; said Mike to Psmith.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go,&#8221; suggested Psmith.&#160;
&#8220;Tell him to write.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike got up.</p>

<p>&#8220;All this is very trying,&#8221;
said Psmith.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m seeing nothing of
you to-day.&#8221;&#160; He turned to the small boy.&#160;
&#8220;Tell Willie,&#8221; he added, &#8220;that Mr.
Jackson will be with him in a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>The emissary departed.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You&#8217;re</i> all right,&#8221;
said Psmith encouragingly.&#160; &#8220;Just you keep
on saying you&#8217;re all right.&#160; Stout denial
is the thing.&#160; Don&#8217;t go in for any airy
explanations.&#160; Simply stick to stout denial.&#160;
You can&#8217;t beat it.&#8221;</p>

<p>With which expert advice, he allowed Mike to go on
his way.</p>

<p>He had not been gone two minutes,
when Psmith, who had leaned back in his chair, wrapped
in thought, heaved himself up again.&#160; He stood
for a moment straightening his tie at the looking-glass;
then he picked up his hat and moved slowly out of
the door and down the passage.&#160; Thence, at the
same dignified rate of progress, out of the house and
in at Downing&#8217;s front gate.</p>

<p>The postman was at the door when he
got there, apparently absorbed in conversation with
the parlour-maid.&#160; Psmith stood by politely till
the postman, who had just been told it was like his
impudence, caught sight of him, and, having handed
over the letters in an ultra-formal and professional
manner, passed away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Mr. Downing at home?&#8221; inquired Psmith.</p>

<p>He was, it seemed.&#160; Psmith was
shown into the dining-room on the left of the hall,
and requested to wait.&#160; He was examining a portrait
of Mr. Downing which hung on the wall, when the housemaster
came in.</p>

<p>&#8220;An excellent likeness, sir,&#8221;
said Psmith, with a gesture of the hand towards the
painting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Smith,&#8221; said Mr.
Downing shortly, &#8220;what do you wish to see me
about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was in connection with the
regrettable painting of your dog, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; said Mr. Downing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did it, sir,&#8221; said
Psmith, stopping and flicking a piece of fluff off
his knee.</p>

<h3 class="chap"><a name="ch58">
CHAPTER LVIII<br><br>
THE ARTIST CLAIMS HIS WORK</a></h3>

<p>The line of action which Psmith had
called Stout Denial is an excellent line to adopt,
especially if you really are innocent, but it does
not lead to anything in the shape of a bright and snappy
dialogue between accuser and accused.&#160; Both Mike
and the headmaster were oppressed by a feeling that
the situation was difficult.&#160; The atmosphere was
heavy, and conversation showed a tendency to flag.&#160;
The headmaster had opened brightly enough, with a
summary of the evidence which Mr. Downing had laid
before him, but after that a massive silence had been
the order of the day.&#160; There is nothing in this
world quite so stolid and uncommunicative as a boy
who has made up his mind to be stolid and uncommunicative;
and the headmaster, as he sat and looked at Mike,
who sat and looked past him at the bookshelves, felt
awkward.&#160; It was a scene which needed either a
dramatic interruption or a neat exit speech.&#160;
As it happened, what it got was the dramatic interruption.</p>

<p>The headmaster was just saying, &#8220;I
do not think you fully realise, Jackson, the extent
to which appearances&#8212;&#173;&#8221; &#8212;&#173;which
was practically going back to the beginning and starting
again&#8212;&#173;when there was a knock at the door.&#160;
A voice without said, &#8220;Mr. Downing to see you,
sir,&#8221; and the chief witness for the prosecution
burst in.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would not have interrupted
you,&#8221; said Mr. Downing, &#8220;but&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all, Mr. Downing.&#160; Is there anything
I can&#8212;&#8212;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have discovered&#8212;&#173;I
have been informed&#8212;&#173;In short, it was not
Jackson, who committed the&#8212;&#173;who painted my
dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike and the headmaster both looked
at the speaker.&#160; Mike with a feeling of relief&#8212;&#173;for
Stout Denial, unsupported by any weighty evidence,
is a wearing game to play&#8212;&#173;the headmaster
with astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not Jackson?&#8221; said the headmaster.</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#160; It was a boy in the same house.&#160;
Smith.&#8221;</p>

<p>Psmith!&#160; Mike was more than surprised.&#160;
He could not believe it.&#160; There is nothing which
affords so clear an index to a boy&#8217;s character
as the type of rag which he considers humorous.&#160;
Between what is a rag and what is merely a rotten
trick there is a very definite line drawn.&#160; Masters,
as a rule, do not realise this, but boys nearly always
do.&#160; Mike could not imagine Psmith doing a rotten
thing like covering a housemaster&#8217;s dog with
red paint, any more than he could imagine doing it
himself.&#160; They had both been amused at the sight
of Sammy after the operation, but anybody, except
possibly the owner of the dog, would have thought
it funny at first.&#160; After the first surprise, their
feeling had been that it was a scuggish thing to have
done and beastly rough luck on the poor brute.&#160;
It was a kid&#8217;s trick.&#160; As for Psmith having
done it, Mike simply did not believe it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Smith!&#8221; said the headmaster.&#160; &#8220;What
makes you think that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Simply this,&#8221; said Mr.
Downing, with calm triumph, &#8220;that the boy himself
came to me a few moments ago and confessed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike was conscious of a feeling of
acute depression.&#160; It did not make him in the
least degree jubilant, or even thankful, to know that
he himself was cleared of the charge.&#160; All he
could think of was that Psmith was done for.&#160;
This was bound to mean the sack.&#160; If Psmith had
painted Sammy, it meant that Psmith had broken out
of his house at night:&#160; and it was not likely
that the rules about nocturnal wandering were less
strict at Sedleigh than at any other school in the
kingdom.&#160; Mike felt, if possible, worse than he
had felt when Wyatt had been caught on a similar occasion.&#160;
It seemed as if Fate had a special grudge against
his best friends.&#160; He did not make friends very
quickly or easily, though he had always had scores
of acquaintances&#8212;&#173;and with Wyatt and Psmith
he had found himself at home from the first moment
he had met them.</p>

<p>He sat there, with a curious feeling
of having swallowed a heavy weight, hardly listening
to what Mr. Downing was saying.&#160; Mr. Downing was
talking rapidly to the headmaster, who was nodding
from time to time.</p>

<p>Mike took advantage of a pause to
get up.&#160; &#8220;May I go, sir?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, Jackson, certainly,&#8221;
said the Head.&#160; &#8220;Oh, and er&#8212;&#173;,
if you are going back to your house, tell Smith that
I should like to see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had reached the door, when again there was a knock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; said the headmaster.</p>

<p>It was Adair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Adair?&#8221;</p>

<p>Adair was breathing rather heavily, as if he had been
running.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was about Sammy&#8212;&#173;Sampson, sir,&#8221;
he said, looking at Mr. Downing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, we know&#8212;.&#160; Well, Adair, what
did you wish to say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t Jackson who did it, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, Adair.&#160; So Mr. Downing&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was Dunster, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Terrific sensation!&#160; The headmaster
gave a sort of strangled yelp of astonishment.&#160;
Mr. Downing leaped in his chair.&#160; Mike&#8217;s
eyes opened to their fullest extent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Adair!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was almost a wail in the headmaster&#8217;s
voice.&#160; The situation had suddenly become too
much for him.&#160; His brain was swimming.&#160; That
Mike, despite the evidence against him, should be
innocent, was curious, perhaps, but not particularly
startling.&#160; But that Adair should inform him,
two minutes after Mr. Downing&#8217;s announcement
of Psmith&#8217;s confession, that Psmith, too, was
guiltless, and that the real criminal was Dunster&#8212;&#173;it
was this that made him feel that somebody, in the
words of an American author, had played a mean trick
on him, and substituted for his brain a side-order
of cauliflower.&#160; Why Dunster, of all people?&#160;
Dunster, who, he remembered dizzily, had left the school
at Christmas.&#160; And why, if Dunster had really painted
the dog, had Psmith asserted that he himself was the
culprit?&#160; Why&#8212;&#173;why anything?&#160; He
concentrated his mind on Adair as the only person who
could save him from impending brain-fever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Adair!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8212;&#173;<i>what</i> do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It <i>was</i> Dunster, sir.&#160;
I got a letter from him only five minutes ago, in
which he said that he had painted Sammy&#8212;&#173;Sampson,
the dog, sir, for a rag&#8212;&#173;for a joke, and
that, as he didn&#8217;t want any one here to get
into a row&#8212;&#173;be punished for it, I&#8217;d
better tell Mr. Downing at once.&#160; I tried to find
Mr. Downing, but he wasn&#8217;t in the house.&#160;
Then I met Smith outside the house, and he told me
that Mr. Downing had gone over to see you, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Smith told you?&#8221; said Mr. Downing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you say anything to him
about your having received this letter from Dunster?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I gave him the letter to read, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what was his attitude when he had read
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He laughed, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Laughed!</i>&#8221; Mr. Downing&#8217;s
voice was thunderous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#160; He rolled about.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downing snorted.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Adair,&#8221; said the
headmaster, &#8220;I do not understand how this thing
could have been done by Dunster.&#160; He has left the
school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was down here for the Old
Sedleighans&#8217; match, sir.&#160; He stopped the
night in the village.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that was the night the&#8212;&#173;it happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see.&#160; Well, I am glad
to find that the blame cannot be attached to any boy
in the school.&#160; I am sorry that it is even an Old
Boy.&#160; It was a foolish, discreditable thing to
have done, but it is not as bad as if any boy still
at the school had broken out of his house at night
to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The sergeant,&#8221; said Mr.
Downing, &#8220;told me that the boy he saw was attempting
to enter Mr. Outwood&#8217;s house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Another freak of Dunster&#8217;s,
I suppose,&#8221; said the headmaster.&#160; &#8220;I
shall write to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it was really Dunster who
painted my dog,&#8221; said Mr. Downing, &#8220;I
cannot understand the part played by Smith in this
affair.&#160; If he did not do it, what possible motive
could he have had for coming to me of his own accord
and deliberately confessing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure,&#8221; said the
headmaster, pressing a bell.&#160; &#8220;It is certainly
a thing that calls for explanation.&#160; Barlow,&#8221;
he said, as the butler appeared, &#8220;kindly go
across to Mr. Outwood&#8217;s house and inform Smith
that I should like to see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you please, sir, Mr. Smith is waiting in
the hall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the hall!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#160; He arrived soon
after Mr. Adair, sir, saying that he would wait, as
you would probably wish to see him shortly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m.&#160; Ask him to step up, Barlow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>There followed one of the tensest
&#8220;stage waits&#8221; of Mike&#8217;s experience.&#160;
It was not long, but, while it lasted, the silence
was quite solid.&#160; Nobody seemed to have anything
to say, and there was not even a clock in the room
to break the stillness with its ticking.&#160; A very
faint drip-drip of rain could be heard outside the
window.</p>

<p>Presently there was a sound of footsteps
on the stairs.&#160; The door was opened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Smith, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old Etonian entered as would the
guest of the evening who is a few moments late for
dinner.&#160; He was cheerful, but slightly deprecating.&#160;
He gave the impression of one who, though sure of
his welcome, feels that some slight apology is expected
from him.&#160; He advanced into the room with a gentle
half-smile which suggested good-will to all men.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is still raining,&#8221;
he observed.&#160; &#8220;You wished to see me, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, Smith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>He dropped into a deep arm-chair (which
both Adair and Mike had avoided in favour of less
luxurious seats) with the confidential cosiness of
a fashionable physician calling on a patient, between
whom and himself time has broken down the barriers
of restraint and formality.</p>

<p>Mr. Downing burst out, like a reservoir that has broken
its banks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Smith.&#8221;</p>

<p>Psmith turned his gaze politely in the housemaster&#8217;s
direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Smith, you came to me a quarter
of an hour ago and told me that it was you who had
painted my dog Sampson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was absolutely untrue?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid so, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Smith&#8212;&#173;&#8221; began the headmaster.</p>

<p>Psmith bent forward encouragingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8212;&#8212;&#173;This is
a most extraordinary affair.&#160; Have you no explanation
to offer?&#160; What induced you to do such a thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>Psmith sighed softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The craze for notoriety, sir,&#8221;
he replied sadly.&#160; &#8220;The curse of the present
age.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; cried the headmaster.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is remarkable,&#8221; proceeded
Psmith placidly, with the impersonal touch of one
lecturing on generalities, &#8220;how frequently, when
a murder has been committed, one finds men confessing
that they have done it when it is out of the question
that they should have committed it.&#160; It is one
of the most interesting problems with which anthropologists
are confronted.&#160; Human nature&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>The headmaster interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Smith,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I
should like to see you alone for a moment.&#160; Mr.
Downing might I trouble&#8212;?&#160; Adair, Jackson.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made a motion towards the door.</p>

<p>When he and Psmith were alone, there
was silence.&#160; Psmith leaned back comfortably in
his chair.&#160; The headmaster tapped nervously with
his foot on the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Er&#8212;&#173;Smith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>The headmaster seemed to have some
difficulty in proceeding.&#160; He paused again.&#160;
Then he went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Er&#8212;&#173;Smith, I do not
for a moment wish to pain you, but have you&#8212;&#173;er,
do you remember ever having had, as a child, let us
say, any&#8212;&#173;er&#8212;&#173;severe illness?&#160;
Any&#8212;&#173;er&#8212;&#173;<i>mental</i> illness?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no&#8212;&#173;forgive
me if I am touching on a sad subject&#8212;&#173;there
is no&#8212;&#173;none of your near relatives have ever
suffered in the way I&#8212;&#173;er&#8212;&#173;have
described?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t a lunatic
on the list, sir,&#8221; said Psmith cheerfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, Smith, of course,&#8221;
said the headmaster hurriedly, &#8220;I did not mean
to suggest&#8212;&#173;quite so, quite so....&#160; You
think, then, that you confessed to an act which you
had not committed purely from some sudden impulse
which you cannot explain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Strictly between ourselves, sir&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>Privately, the headmaster found Psmith&#8217;s
man-to-man attitude somewhat disconcerting, but he
said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Smith?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should not like it to go any further, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will certainly respect any confidence&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want anybody
to know, sir.&#160; This is strictly between ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you are sometimes apt
to forget, Smith, the proper relations existing between
boy and&#8212;&#173;Well, never mind that for the present.&#160;
We can return to it later.&#160; For the moment, let
me hear what you wish to say.&#160; I shall, of course,
tell nobody, if you do not wish it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it was like this, sir,&#8221;
said Psmith.&#160; &#8220;Jackson happened to tell
me that you and Mr. Downing seemed to think he had
painted Mr. Downing&#8217;s dog, and there seemed
some danger of his being expelled, so I thought it
wouldn&#8217;t be an unsound scheme if I were to go
and say I had done it.&#160; That was the whole thing.&#160;
Of course, Dunster writing created a certain amount
of confusion.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a very wrong thing to
do, Smith,&#8221; said the headmaster, at last, &#8220;but....&#160;
You are a curious boy, Smith.&#160; Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>He held out his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, sir,&#8221; said Psmith.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bad old sort,&#8221;
said Psmith meditatively to himself, as he walked
downstairs.&#160; &#8220;By no means a bad old sort.&#160;
I must drop in from time to time and cultivate him.&#8221;</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>Mike and Adair were waiting for him
outside the front door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>are</i> the limit,&#8221; said Adair.&#160;
&#8220;What&#8217;s he done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing.&#160; We had a very pleasant chat,
and then I tore myself away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say he&#8217;s not going to
do a thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re a marvel,&#8221; said Adair.</p>

<p>Psmith thanked him courteously.&#160; They walked on
towards the houses.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, Adair,&#8221; said
Mike, as the latter started to turn in at Downing&#8217;s,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll write to Strachan to-night about
that match.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Psmith.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jackson&#8217;s going to try
and get Wrykyn to give us a game,&#8221; said Adair.&#160;
&#8220;They&#8217;ve got a vacant date.&#160; I hope
the dickens they&#8217;ll do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I should think they&#8217;re certain to,&#8221;
said Mike.&#160; &#8220;Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And give Comrade Downing, when
you see him,&#8221; said Psmith, &#8220;my very best
love.&#160; It is men like him who make this Merrie
England of ours what it is.&#8221;</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>&#8220;I say, Psmith,&#8221; said
Mike suddenly, &#8220;what really made you tell Downing
you&#8217;d done it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The craving for&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, chuck it.&#160; You aren&#8217;t
talking to the Old Man now.&#160; I believe it was
simply to get me out of a jolly tight corner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Psmith&#8217;s expression was one of pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Comrade Jackson,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;you wrong me.&#160; You make me writhe.&#160;
I&#8217;m surprised at you.&#160; I never thought to
hear those words from Michael Jackson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I believe you did, all
the same,&#8221; said Mike obstinately.&#160; &#8220;And
it was jolly good of you, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Psmith moaned.</p>

CHAPTER LIX<br><br>
SEDLEIGH <i>v</i>. WRYKYN</a></h3>

<p>The Wrykyn match was three-parts over,
and things were going badly for Sedleigh.&#160; In
a way one might have said that the game was over, and
that Sedleigh had lost; for it was a one day match,
and Wrykyn, who had led on the first innings, had
only to play out time to make the game theirs.</p>

<p>Sedleigh were paying the penalty for
allowing themselves to be influenced by nerves in
the early part of the day.&#160; Nerves lose more school
matches than good play ever won.&#160; There is a certain
type of school batsman who is a gift to any bowler
when he once lets his imagination run away with him.&#160;
Sedleigh, with the exception of Adair, Psmith, and
Mike, had entered upon this match in a state of the
most azure funk.&#160; Ever since Mike had received
Strachan&#8217;s answer and Adair had announced on
the notice-board that on Saturday, July the twentieth,
Sedleigh would play Wrykyn, the team had been all on
the jump.&#160; It was useless for Adair to tell them,
as he did repeatedly, on Mike&#8217;s authority, that
Wrykyn were weak this season, and that on their present
form Sedleigh ought to win easily.&#160; The team listened,
but were not comforted.&#160; Wrykyn might be below
their usual strength, but then Wrykyn cricket, as
a rule, reached such a high standard that this probably
meant little.&#160; However weak Wrykyn might be&#8212;&#173;for
them&#8212;&#173;there was a very firm impression among
the members of the Sedleigh first eleven that the
other school was quite strong enough to knock the
cover off <i>them</i>.&#160; Experience counts enormously
in school matches.&#160; Sedleigh had never been proved.&#160;
The teams they played were the sort of sides which
the Wrykyn second eleven would play.&#160; Whereas Wrykyn,
from time immemorial, had been beating Ripton teams
and Free Foresters teams and M.C.C. teams packed with
county men and sending men to Oxford and Cambridge
who got their blues as freshmen.</p>

<p>Sedleigh had gone on to the field
that morning a depressed side.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate that Adair had
won the toss.&#160; He had had no choice but to take
first innings.&#160; The weather had been bad for the
last week, and the wicket was slow and treacherous.&#160;
It was likely to get worse during the day, so Adair
had chosen to bat first.</p>

<p>Taking into consideration the state
of nerves the team was in, this in itself was a calamity.&#160;
A school eleven are always at their worst and nerviest
before lunch.&#160; Even on their own ground they find
the surroundings lonely and unfamiliar.&#160; The subtlety
of the bowlers becomes magnified.&#160; Unless the
first pair make a really good start, a collapse almost
invariably ensues.</p>

<p>To-day the start had been gruesome
beyond words.&#160; Mike, the bulwark of the side,
the man who had been brought up on Wrykyn bowling,
and from whom, whatever might happen to the others,
at least a fifty was expected&#8212;&#173;Mike, going
in first with Barnes and taking first over, had played
inside one from Bruce, the Wrykyn slow bowler, and
had been caught at short slip off his second ball.</p>

<p>That put the finishing-touch on the
panic.&#160; Stone, Robinson, and the others, all quite
decent punishing batsmen when their nerves allowed
them to play their own game, crawled to the wickets,
declined to hit out at anything, and were clean bowled,
several of them, playing back to half-volleys.&#160;
Adair did not suffer from panic, but his batting was
not equal to his bowling, and he had fallen after hitting
one four.&#160; Seven wickets were down for thirty
when Psmith went in.</p>

<p>Psmith had always disclaimed any pretensions
to batting skill, but he was undoubtedly the right
man for a crisis like this.&#160; He had an enormous
reach, and he used it.&#160; Three consecutive balls
from Bruce he turned into full-tosses and swept to
the leg-boundary, and, assisted by Barnes, who had
been sitting on the splice in his usual manner, he
raised the total to seventy-one before being yorked,
with his score at thirty-five.&#160; Ten minutes later
the innings was over, with Barnes not out sixteen,
for seventy-nine.</p>

<p>Wrykyn had then gone in, lost Strachan
for twenty before lunch, and finally completed their
innings at a quarter to four for a hundred and thirty-one.</p>

<p>This was better than Sedleigh had
expected.&#160; At least eight of the team had looked
forward dismally to an afternoon&#8217;s leather-hunting.&#160;
But Adair and Psmith, helped by the wicket, had never
been easy, especially Psmith, who had taken six wickets,
his slows playing havoc with the tail.</p>

<p>It would be too much to say that Sedleigh
had any hope of pulling the game out of the fire;
but it was a comfort, they felt, at any rate, having
another knock.&#160; As is usual at this stage of a
match, their nervousness had vanished, and they felt
capable of better things than in the first innings.</p>

<p>It was on Mike&#8217;s suggestion
that Psmith and himself went in first.&#160; Mike knew
the limitations of the Wrykyn bowling, and he was convinced
that, if they could knock Bruce off, it might be possible
to rattle up a score sufficient to give them the game,
always provided that Wrykyn collapsed in the second
innings.&#160; And it seemed to Mike that the wicket
would be so bad then that they easily might.</p>

<p>So he and Psmith had gone in at four
o&#8217;clock to hit.&#160; And they had hit.&#160;
The deficit had been wiped off, all but a dozen runs,
when Psmith was bowled, and by that time Mike was
set and in his best vein.&#160; He treated all the
bowlers alike.&#160; And when Stone came in, restored
to his proper frame of mind, and lashed out stoutly,
and after him Robinson and the rest, it looked as
if Sedleigh had a chance again.&#160; The score was
a hundred and twenty when Mike, who had just reached
his fifty, skied one to Strachan at cover.&#160; The
time was twenty-five past five.</p>

<p>As Mike reached the pavilion, Adair
declared the innings closed.</p>

<p>Wrykyn started batting at twenty-five
minutes to six, with sixty-nine to make if they wished
to make them, and an hour and ten minutes during which
to keep up their wickets if they preferred to take
things easy and go for a win on the first innings.</p>

<p>At first it looked as if they meant
to knock off the runs, for Strachan forced the game
from the first ball, which was Psmith&#8217;s, and
which he hit into the pavilion.&#160; But, at fifteen,
Adair bowled him.&#160; And when, two runs later, Psmith
got the next man stumped, and finished up his over
with a c-and-b, Wrykyn decided that it was not good
enough.&#160; Seventeen for three, with an hour all
but five minutes to go, was getting too dangerous.&#160;
So Drummond and Rigby, the next pair, proceeded to
play with caution, and the collapse ceased.</p>

<p>This was the state of the game at
the point at which this chapter opened.&#160; Seventeen
for three had become twenty-four for three, and the
hands of the clock stood at ten minutes past six.&#160;
Changes of bowling had been tried, but there seemed
no chance of getting past the batsmen&#8217;s defence.&#160;
They were playing all the good balls, and refused
to hit at the bad.</p>

<p>A quarter past six struck, and then
Psmith made a suggestion which altered the game completely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you have a
shot this end?&#8221; he said to Adair, as they were
crossing over.&#160; &#8220;There&#8217;s a spot on
the off which might help you a lot.&#160; You can break
like blazes if only you land on it.&#160; It doesn&#8217;t
help my leg-breaks a bit, because they won&#8217;t
hit at them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes was on the point of beginning
to bowl, when Adair took the ball from him.&#160; The
captain of Outwood&#8217;s retired to short leg with
an air that suggested that he was glad to be relieved
of his prominent post.</p>

<p>The next moment Drummond&#8217;s off-stump
was lying at an angle of forty-five.&#160; Adair was
absolutely accurate as a bowler, and he had dropped
his first ball right on the worn patch.</p>

<p>Two minutes later Drummond&#8217;s
successor was retiring to the pavilion, while the
wicket-keeper straightened the stumps again.</p>

<p>There is nothing like a couple of
unexpected wickets for altering the atmosphere of
a game.&#160; Five minutes before, Sedleigh had been
lethargic and without hope.&#160; Now there was a stir
and buzz all round the ground.&#160; There were twenty-five
minutes to go, and five wickets were down.&#160; Sedleigh
was on top again.</p>

<p>The next man seemed to take an age
coming out.&#160; As a matter of fact, he walked more
rapidly than a batsman usually walks to the crease.</p>

<p>Adair&#8217;s third ball dropped just
short of the spot.&#160; The batsman, hitting out,
was a shade too soon.&#160; The ball hummed through
the air a couple of feet from the ground in the direction
of mid-off, and Mike, diving to the right, got to
it as he was falling, and chucked it up.</p>

<p>After that the thing was a walk-over.&#160;
Psmith clean bowled a man in his next over; and the
tail, demoralised by the sudden change in the game,
collapsed uncompromisingly.&#160; Sedleigh won by thirty-five
runs with eight minutes in hand.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">

<p>Psmith and Mike sat in their study
after lock-up, discussing things in general and the
game in particular.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel like a beastly renegade,
playing against Wrykyn,&#8221; said Mike.&#160; &#8220;Still,
I&#8217;m glad we won.&#160; Adair&#8217;s a jolly good
sort, and it&#8217;ll make him happy for weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I last saw Comrade Adair,&#8221;
said Psmith, &#8220;he was going about in a sort of
trance, beaming vaguely and wanting to stand people
things at the shop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He bowled awfully well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Psmith.&#160;
&#8220;I say, I don&#8217;t wish to cast a gloom over
this joyful occasion in any way, but you say Wrykyn
are going to give Sedleigh a fixture again next year?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, have you thought of the
massacre which will ensue?&#160; You will have left,
Adair will have left.&#160; Incidentally, I shall have
left.&#160; Wrykyn will swamp them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose they will.&#160; Still,
the great thing, you see, is to get the thing started.&#160;
That&#8217;s what Adair was so keen on.&#160; Now Sedleigh
has beaten Wrykyn, he&#8217;s satisfied.&#160; They
can get on fixtures with decent clubs, and work up
to playing the big schools.&#160; You&#8217;ve got to
start somehow.&#160; So it&#8217;s all right, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, besides,&#8221; said Psmith,
reflectively, &#8220;in an emergency they can always
get Comrade Downing to bowl for them, what?&#160; Let
us now sally out and see if we can&#8217;t promote
a rag of some sort in this abode of wrath.&#160; Comrade
Outwood has gone over to dinner at the School House,
and it would be a pity to waste a somewhat golden opportunity.&#160;
Shall we stagger?&#8221;</p>

<p>They staggered.</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
